A leaf says as data what it does when auto. `PrefBase` gains three optional fields: `manual` (never auto), `unpinned` (starts auto), and `autoValue` (what it reads while auto, which need not be its `default`). labkit already wrote the first two onto its leaves from `.manual()` and `.initial(auto)`; they are now part of the type.

`PrefSchemaEditor` edits all three in a new Auto panel of a leaf's attributes. The auto value starts unset, and its label pins it, starting from the default. A leaf with no value, such as an action, gets no panel.

`PrefsForm` gives a `manual` leaf no auto toggle, whatever `canInherit` says. labkit resolves an auto leaf to its `autoValue` where it has no `.auto()` resolver, and `ControlPanel` quotes that value in the row's ⓘ tooltip as it does a resolver's.
