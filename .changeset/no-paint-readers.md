An absent fill or stroke now means none everywhere, read through `resolveFill` and `resolveStroke`. This breaks three things that used to fill in a default:

- **A text node built without a `fill` now draws no glyphs.** Write `fill: { paint: solid('#000') }`, or `DEFAULT_TEXT_FILL`, now exported from `@weasel-js/text` and `@weasel-js/core`. `DEFAULT_TEXT_STYLE.fill` is `null`. The text insert, the sticky note and SVG import write black themselves.
- **A derived part with no `fill` or `stroke` no longer takes its node's.** Write `INHERIT` (`'inherit'`) for that; `DerivedPart` allows it, and `resolvePartPaint` is the one reading of a part's paint.
- **`diagramShape` drops its `defaultFill` and `defaultStroke` options.** An outline paints what its data names; `diagramScene` already writes the default style onto every node. SVG import writes SVG's initial black onto text that names no fill, and SVG export writes `fill="none"` for text that has none.

`setFill` and `setStroke` write None as a record with no `paint` rather than `null`, so a stroke keeps its width and dash; a `paint: null` passed when the gesture starts used to be read as no paint given and painted the default color. The selection panel shows a fill or stroke paint as a paint, None or Mixed, never unset; `nestedPaintValue` is that reading. Booleans, Outline Stroke and the character bar read a fill with no paint as unfilled. Core re-exports `resolveFill`, `resolveStroke`, `INHERIT` and their types.
