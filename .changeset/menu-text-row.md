A menu can hold a line of text edited in place: `MenuTextEntry` (`kind: 'text'`), with the controller's `textValue` and `setText` holding what was typed while the menu stays open. A string leaf in a schema drawn as a menu becomes one when something writes it, and stays a read-only `Name: value` row when it is a `readout` or nothing does. The DOM menu draws a text field that Enter on the row focuses; Enter or blur writes the text and Escape puts it back. The HUD menu has no text entry, so it draws the row's value read-only.
