New package, `@weasel-js/headless`: a list's roving highlight and typeahead, generic over the item type. `rovingKey` moves a highlight on the arrows, Home and End, skipping items `canStop` refuses, for a vertical or horizontal list, with or without wrap; `typeaheadStep` finds an item by its typed prefix and cycles on a repeated letter. `@weasel-js/menu` now runs each menu level on them and depends on the new package; its own exports and behavior are unchanged.
