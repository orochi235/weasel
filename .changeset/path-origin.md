A `PolygonPath` can carry an `origin`, the point its `coords` are measured from, in doubles; a `Mesh` built from one carries it too. This adds API. Far from 0 a float32 coordinate loses its fraction (at x = 262,144 it sits on a 1/32 grid, 2 px at 64x); measured from an origin beside the shape it keeps it. `PathBuilder.setOrigin(x, y)` builds such a path from points given in the path's own space.

The renderer draws one where its origin puts it, batched or by its own draw, filled, stroked, clipped, and culled. `tessellate`, `tessellateStroke`, `markerHeads`, `strokeToPath`, `transformPath` and `boundsOfPath` honor it, and so does a node's stroked bounds.
