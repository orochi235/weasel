Adds API: `cssColorLiteral(css)` in `@weasel-js/paint` reads any color string `parseColor` reads as an `srgb` `ColorLiteral`, and throws as it does on one it cannot. `colorLiteralToCss(literal)` writes a literal as a CSS color: hex where `colorLiteralToHex` has one, else `color(<space> …)`.

Adds API: `@weasel-js/theme` resolves a paint `ColorSource` under a theme. `colorSourceCss(source, ctx?)` writes one as a CSS color and `colorSourceLiteral(source, ctx?)` resolves one to a literal for a surface with no cascade; `useColorCss()` in `@weasel-js/theme/react` is the first against the provider in force. A `ColorRef` names, in order: an entry of the palette on the context; `tone` (`TONE_REF`) with an index into the tone list, wrapping; a theme token by its name without the `--wzl-` prefix (`{ ref: 'accent' }`); a ramp by name with the index of a step (`{ ref: 'swatch', index: 3 }`); or a custom property spelled out (`{ ref: '--my-color' }`), which need not be the theme's. A ref the theme answers is written to CSS as its custom property, so it follows a mode change without a re-render; a palette entry or a function is written as the literal it resolves to in the provider's selection.

Adds API: `<ThemeProvider palette>` takes a paint `Palette` whose names a `ColorRef` in that subtree resolves before the theme's own, and `ThemeContextValue` carries it as `palette`. These rules for what a ref names were chosen on an agent's judgment.

Breaking: a `tone` is `number | ColorSource`, no longer `number | string`. That is `StanceProps.tone` in `@weasel-js/ui`, so every stanced surface (`Badge`, `Button`, `Callout`, `Code`, `Dialog`, `LayerList` items, `MotifFrame`, `Powerline` segments, `PropertyGroup`, `PropertyPanel`, `Subpanel`), labkit's `ControlPanel`, `ControlMatrix`, and sidebar sections, and forge's `Library.tone`. An index is unchanged. A CSS string no longer typechecks: write a color as `cssColorLiteral('#2b6cb0')`, a theme token as `{ ref: 'accent' }`, and anything only CSS can say as a custom property of your own, `{ ref: '--my-tone' }`. A tone nothing answers now draws as no tone. `@weasel-js/ui` now depends on `@weasel-js/paint`.

Breaking: the other colors `@weasel-js/ui` takes are `ColorSource` too, each written through `useColorCss`: `Plot2D`'s `grid.color` and `axes.color`, `CurveField`'s mark `color`, the `color` of a curve `fill` (`FillSettings`, on `CurveEditor` and `createFunctionLayer`), and the Badge effects' `outline.color`, `sunbeams.color`, `metal.accent`, and `aqua.accent`. Each one's default draws as before.

Breaking: `@weasel-js/hud` names colors the same way. A window's `tone` (`WindowOptions.tone`, `setTone`) is `number | ColorSource`, and the draw contexts (`HudDrawCtx`, `HudContentCtx`) carry `color(source)`, a source resolved to a hex, in place of `toneAt(i)`; a widget that called `ctx.toneAt(2)` calls `ctx.color({ ref: 'tone', index: 2 })`. `AttachHudOptions.tones` is a `ColorSourceContext`, so its tone list is optional and it may carry a palette.
