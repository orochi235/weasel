`Stroke.dashOffset` sets how far into `dash` each subpath starts, as SVG's `stroke-dashoffset` and Canvas2D's `lineDashOffset` do. A negative offset starts before the pattern's beginning, and a non-finite one reads as 0. The canvas, `writePdf` and `serializeSvg` all draw it. `parseSvg` reads `stroke-dashoffset`, which it used to drop with no warning, and `svgNodesToKitDrafts` and `svgStrokeFromKit` carry it. A `{ px }` stroke resolves the offset with its dash, `lerpStroke` interpolates it, and a stroke-mesh cache entry is keyed on it.

New in `@weasel-js/paint`, and re-exported from `@weasel-js/core`: `dashPhase(pattern, phase)` wraps a phase into one cycle of a pattern, and `scaledDash(stroke, k)` scales a dash and its offset together. A trimmed stroke's PDF dash phase is now written wrapped into one cycle (`[4 2] 4 d` where it used to write `[4 2] 10 d`), which draws the same.
