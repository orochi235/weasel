'@weasel-js/stroke': patch
---

Adds API: `strokeToPath`'s options take `frame`, the matrix from the frame a stroke is drawn in to the path's coordinates. The outline is built in that frame and carried back through it, so a stroke under a pose `transform` comes out skewed or stretched the way the canvas draws it, and a `{ px }` width under a view that scales each axis apart holds its thickness on screen when the frame is the inverse of the view's scale. A frame that cannot be inverted gives an empty path. Nothing in core passes it yet.
