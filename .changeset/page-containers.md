Pages are scene nodes. A paged scene has a page run, a root group that lays out its pages in a column or a row, and each page is a group under it that frames and clips what is on it. Content on a page is that page's child, in the page's own coordinates with the origin at its top-left, so a page's content moves with it and dragging onto another page reparents. A scene with a page run is in Pages mode; one without is Continuous. Pages are 2D only.

This is breaking for a consumer that wrote `core:pages` directly, or placed content on pages in world coordinates: the pages are no longer a document value, and a node on a page is positioned relative to it. Stored scenes convert on load: `adoptLegacyPages` turns a `core:pages` value into page nodes and moves each root onto the page holding it, as one untracked batch. `PAGES_DOC_KEY` remains only as the key that conversion reads.

The page edits (`setPages`, `addPage`, `removePage`, `movePage`, `resizePage`, `renamePage`) and readers (`pagesOf`, `placedPagesOf`) keep their names and now work on the nodes. Content placed outside every page goes onto the nearest page unless the page run's `pasteboard` flag is on. A node that follows others (`dependsOn`, such as a connector) goes on the page its ends share, else into the page run. Pages and the run are never selected, deleted, copied or grouped by the scene tools, and the run refuses drops and inserts of anything but followers.

- `@weasel-js/core` exports `createPageRun`, `pageRunOf`, `isPaged`, `pageOfNode`, `PAGE_RUN` and `pageRunLayout`, `PAGE_CLIP` and `pageClip`, `adoptLegacyPages`, `placeOnPages` (moves world-space specs onto their pages), `followerHome`, `isPageStructure`, `withoutPageStructure`, `contentRoots`, and, from the routing barrel, `insertSite` with `InsertSite` and `InsertSiteOptions`. Nodes gain `page` and `pageRun` fields, which save with the scene, and scenes gain `setPage` and `setPageRun`. `LayoutContainer` and `LayoutChild` gain an optional `node`.
- `@weasel-js/editor`: `usePages` takes `{ paging }` as its last argument, `'continuous'` (the default) or `'single'`, which settles the view fitted to one page through the new `usePageSettle`. `adoptSnapshotPages` converts a snapshot saved with `core:pages`, which `nodeSpecsFromSnapshot` now does, and `useSessionPersistence` drops the undo stack saved beside one.
- `@weasel-js/diagram`: `OffPageEdgeInput` is now `{ id, fromPage, toPage, offPage? }`, each end's page read from its page ancestor. `OffPageMarkerOptions` loses `geometry` and its type parameter. A stencil drawn on a paged scene lands on the page under it.
- `@weasel-js/diagram-formats`: `DocumentScene` gains `pages`. `addDocumentScene` replaces a scene's content, pages and document values with a `DocumentScene` in one undo entry, and `addOnPages` adds world-space specs onto the pages under them.
