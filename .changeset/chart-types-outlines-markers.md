Diagram outlines are now a registrable table. `registerOutline(name, def)` adds a named outline (or shadows a built-in until disposed), `outlineFromD(d, opts)` builds one from unit-square SVG path data, and `outlineDetail` gives the strokes an outline draws over its fill. `Outline` widens to any registered name; an unregistered one paints as `rect` and warns once. Eleven built-ins join the flowchart seven: `roundRect`, `cylinder`, `document`, `note`, `cloud`, `triangle`, `octagon`, `folder`, `cube`, `actor`, and `doubleEllipse`. Each keeps its content box inside the visible shape, and `diagramShape` strokes a cylinder's rim, a note's fold, a folder's tab, a cube's front edges, and a double ellipse's inner ring.

New stroke markers: the crow's-foot family `crow-one`, `crow-many`, `crow-zero-one`, `crow-one-many`, and `crow-zero-many`, and `triangle-hollow` for UML generalization. `KitMarkerKey` lists them.

DOT, Mermaid, and draw-style XML read and write the new outlines and markers where the format has a counterpart. Mermaid's writer no longer throws on an outline it has no brackets for: it writes a rectangle and warns. draw-style XML reads `rounded=1` below the stadium arc as `roundRect`, a hollow `block` head as `triangle-hollow`, Mermaid reads `(text)` as `roundRect`, and DOT and Mermaid read a double circle as `doubleEllipse`. DOT reads `onormal` as `triangle-hollow`.
