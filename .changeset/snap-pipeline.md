One snap pipeline for every gesture. Move, resize, rotate, insert (drag and click-place), pen and spiro placement, pen handles, anchor and handle drags in path edit, measure, and the symmetry center all begin a session on the `snap` dep at press and ask it each frame where their point lands. Every kind of target is a snap source, and one resolver ranks all of their candidates together: a point beats a line, a real target beats a fallback such as the grid, then the smaller move on screen wins, then source order. One readout layer draws what the result met. `docs/snapping.md` is the reference.

**Breaking: removed APIs, with their replacements.**

- `SnapDep.point` is gone: the `snap` dep is `begin(req)`, which returns a `SnapSession` (`at`, `angle`, `end`).
- `<SceneCanvas toolOptions={{ snapPoint }}>` is gone: register a source in `<SceneCanvas snap={{ sources }}>`, `gridSnapSource` for a grid.
- `selectTool.snap`, `SnapStrategy`, and core's `snap()` behavior adapter are gone: a grid is `gridSnapSource({ spacing, origin?, unitSystem? })`, ruler guides `guideSnapSource(getGuides)`. A pose that is neither a rect nor a `Path` passes its `OriginProjection` as `snap={{ originProjection }}`. Moving from `selectTool.snap: gridSnapStrategy(…)` to `gridSnapSource` also snaps resize corners, inserts and pen clicks to the grid, not only a move's origin.
- `@weasel-js/guides`: `gridSnapStrategy`, `guideSnapStrategy`, `GuideSnapOptions`, `DEFAULT_GUIDE_TOLERANCE_PX`, and `pointSnapToGrid` are gone, and so are the `@weasel-js/guides/move`, `/resize` and `/insert` subpaths with their `snapToGrid`, `snapToGuides`, `SnapToGuidesMoveArgs`, `SnapToGuidesResizeArgs` and `SnapToGuidesInsertArgs`: use `gridSnapSource` and `guideSnapSource`. An import of `snapToGrid` from `@weasel-js/core/move` (a subpath that no longer had it) becomes `gridSnapSource` from `@weasel-js/guides`.
- `@weasel-js/guides`: `alignMoveBehavior`, `alignInsertBehavior`, `alignResizeBehavior`, `AlignMoveArgs`, `AlignmentBehaviorBase`, `matchAlignment`, `MOVE_ANCHORS`, `AlignAnchor` and `AlignMatchResult` are gone: `alignmentSnapSource(opts)` snaps to siblings' edges and centers and `spacingSnapSource(opts)` to equal gaps, on move, resize and insert alike. `matchSpacing` and `measureGaps` stay.
- `PointSnapBehavior`, `PointSnapContext`, `PointSnapResult`, `PointSnapFrame`, `ResizePolicy.pointSnap`, `useResizePolicy`'s `pointSnap`, and the resize option `pointSnapBehaviors` are gone: a resize snaps its dragged corner or edges through the session, so any source snaps it.
- `lockAspectWithModifier` (with its `{ key }` option) and `DEFAULT_RESIZE_BEHAVIORS` are gone from `@weasel-js/core/resize`: Shift's aspect lock is the resize's `snap.constrain` role.
- `snapRotationWithModifier`, `DEFAULT_ROTATION_SNAP_STEP` and `DEFAULT_ROTATE_BEHAVIORS` are gone: rotation snaps through `rotationSnapSource`, which every canvas asks, and the `snap.constrain` role (Shift) adds the 15° steps. `rotate: { behaviors: [] }` no longer turns rotation snapping off; `<SceneCanvas snap={{ omit: ['rotation'] }}>` does, and a source with the id `'rotation'` replaces the default.
- `constrainTo45` is gone from `@weasel-js/core`: the pen's handle Shift is the session's angle step.
- `usePenTool`'s `snapPoint` and `anchorSnapRadius` options are gone, and `useDragRect`'s and `useDragRadial`'s `snapPoint`: the pen and the drag gestures snap through the `snap` dep (`pathSnapSource` for anchors, `gridSnapSource` for a grid). A pen anchor joins an open end within `targets.penCloseHitPx` of the press before any snap.
- kernel3d's `createSnap()` took nothing and snapped nothing; `createSnap(world, { sources?, reachPx?, store? })` takes the world and snaps.

**New.**

- `<SceneCanvas snap={{ sources, omit, reachPx, originProjection, readout, readoutStyle }}>` (`SceneCanvasSnap`), a feature preset's `snapSources`, and `useSnapSource(source)`.
- One reach for every source that sets none, the kit setting `targets.snapPx` (8 screen px; `DEFAULT_SNAP_PX`).
- The snap source contract: `SnapSource`, `SnapCollect`, `SourceCandidate`, `Locus`, `SnapProbeAt`, `SnapGesture` (with `'handle'`), `SnapEdge`, `SnapEdges`, `AngleCollect`, `AngleCandidate`, `SnapMark` and `SnapMarks`; the session types `SnapBegin` (with `reachRad` and `theta0`), `SnapConstrain`, `SnapMods`, `SnapOutcome`, `SnapResizeBox`, `SnapSession`.
- Sources: `pathSnapSource` with `PathSnapSourceOptions` (and `only`), `measureEndSource` with `MeasureEndSourceOptions` (`reachPx`), and `rotationSnapSource` in core; `gridSnapSource`, `guideSnapSource`, `alignmentSnapSource` and `spacingSnapSource` in guides; `handleSnapSource` and `HandleSnapOptionsInput` in path-tools (`createHandleSnapPreset` and `createHandleSnapExtension` take options or a thunk of them, and the preset registers the source); `boxSnapSource`, `alignPlaneSource`, `groundGridSource` and `GroundGridSourceOptions` in kernel3d.
- The modifier roles `snap.suspend` (Ctrl) and `snap.constrain` (Shift), declared by every snapping action: `SNAP_ROLES`, `snapMods`, `SNAP_ANGLE_STEP` (the one 15° step for a line insert, a measurement, a rotate and the symmetry axis), `SNAP_AXIS_STEP`, and `stepAngles`.
- The readout: `createSnapReadoutLayer`, `SnapReadoutStyle`, `createSnapOutcomeStore`, the `snapReadout` dep (`SnapReadoutDep`), and the drawing helpers `tickedSegment`, `pillCommands` and `measuredSegmentCommands`. The debug overlay's `snap` feature draws every candidate the resolver weighed.
- Building blocks for a host's own session: `resolveSnap` and its types in `@weasel-js/geom/nd`, with `stepLine` and the flat math under it (`Flat`, `Vec`, `flatDim`, `closestOnFlat`, `closestBetweenFlats`, `intersectFlats`); `gatherSnapCandidates`, `resolvedSnapMarks`, `snapSourcesFor`, `GatherSnapOptions`, `SnapCandidateMark` and `SnapGeometry` in core; `pointSnap`/`PointSnap` for a tool placing points.
- `@weasel-js/geom/3d` gains `vec3`, `distance`, `lerp`, `pointOnRay`, `aabbOfPoints`, `closestPointOnLine`, `closestPointOnSegment` and `closestPointsRayLine`.
- `@weasel-js/core/test-seams` gains `createSnapSession2dForTests` (with `SnapSession2dOptions`), a 2D session for tests outside core; it is not public API.
- kernel3d: `projectSnapMarks` with `ScreenLine` and `ScreenPoint`, `projectPoint`, and `Snap3dOptions`.
- `InsertDep.commit` and `InsertDep.build` take an optional `ends: InsertEnds` (the drag's start, end and `fromCenter`); click-place passes them too. kernel3d's `createInsert` builds its footprint from the two ends cast onto the ground, so a 3D click-place centers its footprint on the snapped ground point.
- path edit: `PathEditDragStart.snap`, `PathEditDrag.end`, `SnapMods.hold`.

**Behavior changes.**

- Every `<SceneCanvas>` snaps point gestures to other nodes' anchors — rect and text corners, ellipse quadrants, path anchors — through a default source with `pathSnapSource`'s id, `'path-snap'`: pen placement and handle tips, spiro points, anchor drags, line and box insert, click-place, measure ends and the measurement end drag, and the symmetry center; not move, resize or rotate. `snap={{ omit: ['path-snap'] }}` drops it, and a consumer's own `pathSnapSource()` replaces it rather than doubling. A point target on the gesture's own `origin` is never offered, so a handle tip does not stick to its anchor.
- A grid gives way to a target in reach on its axis, where alignment used to add its delta on top of the grid's. Guides and alignment reach 8px, not 6.
- Ties between equally good results break by source order, then by the order a source yields its targets.
- Ctrl suspends snapping on every snapping gesture, a pen drag and an anchor drag included; a handle drag keeps Ctrl as its length lock.
- A rotate snaps to quarter turns and to other nodes' angles without Shift (new); near the pivot its reach is capped at 30°.
- Shift on a move locks it to the horizontal, vertical or 45° line through the press (new), and so does Shift on an anchor drag (new).
- Shift on a line insert, a measurement or a pen handle puts the end at the pointer's nearest point on the stepped line through the start (it used to keep the drag's length), and that line meets snap targets.
- An anchor drag meets every point-gesture source, a grid included.
- A multi-root move snaps each root's origin, the nearest winning, not only the first node's.
- A move's behaviors run on the snapped delta, and a behavior's translate stands, so a container's slot preview wins over a snap target in reach.
- A measurement end drag keeps its offset from the press (it used to jump the end to the pointer), and no longer snaps to its own measurement's ends.
- kernel3d's `translate` puts its plane at `up · position`, the same as before for +y up.
