Add `--wzl-font-numeric` and the `Oswald Tabular` face behind it. Oswald has no tabular figures, so `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` aligned nothing in the UI face. `Oswald Tabular` is Oswald's ten digits alone, each centered in the widest digit's width at every weight from 200 to 700, plus a figure space (U+2007) of that width; the token puts it in front of `--wzl-font-ui`, so an element set in `--wzl-font-numeric` gets equal-width digits and every other character from the UI face unchanged. `faces.css` declares the new face, and labkit's `dist/fonts` picks up the file.

The readouts, counts and tick labels in Slider, RangeSlider, Jog, Timeline, Plot2D, Prefs and TokenPanel, labkit's zoom readout and job count, and forge's a11y and info panels now use it. `DetailList`'s figures mode moves from `--wzl-font-mono` to it, keeping the list in the UI face.
