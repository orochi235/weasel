`@weasel-js/kernel3d` is a new package: poses, an orbit camera, ray picking and screen-projected chrome geometry over core's scene graph and dispatcher. It hosts a renderer rather than owning one — a consumer brings its own and the kernel hands it poses — and it takes core as a peer, the same tier `svg`, `diagram` and `loupe` sit in.

Core took no diff for it. `Scene` is generic over its pose and holds a `Pose3` with no adapter; a 3D host passes the dispatcher an identity `clientToWorld` so `ctx.world` stays two numbers and each dep rebuilds the ray from the camera it closes over; tools transfer untouched. The two things that do not transfer are stated rather than guessed: `ViewApi` has no orientation, so the kernel declares a `camera3d` dep of its own, and `PoseDescriptor.remapBounds`/`fromBounds` throw, because a screen rectangle does not name a 3D pose without a depth.

`@weasel-js/geom` gains a `./3d` subpath — vectors, quaternions, 4x4 matrices, ray/AABB and ray/plane intersection, and `transformAabb`. Dependency-free like the rest of the package, and immutable tuples rather than classes, so a pose survives `structuredClone` with its methods intact because it never had any.

Two corrections to code promoted out of the 3D lab. `projectAabbToScreen` now clips each of the box's twelve edges against the near plane instead of dropping the corners behind it; the old behaviour reported a box too small for anything straddling the near plane, and reported almost nothing for a solid the camera sits inside. And the seam that says how big a node is now asks for its world box rather than a local one to transform: a sphere's box is the same under every rotation, and no transform of a local box reproduces that.

`sceneFromJSON`'s `options` argument is now optional. Every field in it already was, so the natural one-argument call did not compile.

Also new: a test that a quaternion pose survives `toJSON` and `sceneFromJSON` with its rotation intact. The claim that `Scene` is dimension-neutral had only ever been run against `setPose` and undo.
