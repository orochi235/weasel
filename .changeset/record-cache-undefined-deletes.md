Setting a record to `undefined` deletes it. `RecordCache.set(name, undefined)` used to hold the record as present while telling listeners it was deleted, and each adapter then did something different: localStorage stored the text `undefined`, which read back as a string, and IndexedDB stored a record other tabs heard as a delete. Through `PrefsStore.set`, clearing a clearable enum in a prefs form left the leaf counted as set, with that stray record behind it. It now unsets the leaf.
