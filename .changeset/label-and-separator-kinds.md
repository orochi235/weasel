`label` and `separator` are built-in pref kinds (`PrefLabel`, `PrefSeparator`): leaves that hold no value, so a store skips them and neither is a `PrefPath`. Every params surface now draws them the same way, through `PrefLabelLine` and `PrefRule` from `@weasel-js/ui`: `SelectionPanel` and labkit's `ControlPanel` drew each as an unknown kind before. labkit's builder gains `f.label(text)` and `f.separator()`. `prefFieldChoices` no longer offers either as a field, and `PrefSchemaEditor` offers a label its name, description, and Hidden, and a separator Hidden alone. Code that switches over every `PrefKind` needs an arm for the two.
