New `@weasel-js/storage` package: the storage adapters and `RecordCache` that lived in labkit, split into one module per adapter. localStorage, sessionStorage, memory, and the no-op adapter gain `listSync`, and `openRecordsSync` opens a record cache over them without awaiting. `fallbackStorage(preferred, fallback, label)` wraps an adapter with a fallback for when it is unavailable, and `createDefaultStorage(preferred, label)` builds a page-wide default from one: `preferred`, or localStorage where it will not open, chosen once. Storage's own `indexedDbAdapter` and `defaultStorage` use the IndexedDB database `'weasel'`. `RecordCache.flush()` now resolves `true` when every queued write landed and `false` otherwise; it used to resolve to nothing. labkit re-exports the adapters, and its `indexedDbAdapter` and default storage stay on the database `'labkit'`, where every existing lab's records are.

New `@weasel-js/prefs` package: the preferences schema, moved out of core, and a store for it. `openPrefs` and `openPrefsSync` keep one record per leaf and repair values against the schema on read. `store.stored()` returns the raw stored records as a tree, orphans included, and `usePrefsValues` returns it as `stored`. Versioned migrations run on open: a malformed `$version` opens the store read-only, and a newer `$version` written by another writer stops this store from persisting. `Infinity` and `-Infinity` on number leaves are stored as the strings `'Infinity'` and `'-Infinity'`. `PrefsStore.flush()` resolves a boolean, with the same meaning as `RecordCache.flush()`. The `usePref` and `usePrefsValues` hooks, imported from `@weasel-js/prefs/react`, produce the values `PrefsForm` takes; the main entry loads no React.

Breaking: the schema types are renamed from `ToolPref*` to `Pref*` (`ToolPref` itself is `BuiltinPref`, `TOOL_PREF_KINDS` is `PREF_KINDS`, `isBuiltinToolPref` is `isBuiltinPref`) and are imported from `@weasel-js/prefs`. Neither core, ui, nor `@weasel-js/labkit/weasel-ui` re-exports them, nor ui's `isPrefLeaf`, `prefValueAtPath`, `visiblePrefSubtree`, `filterPrefSubtree`, or `prefDisplayBounds`. labkit's cross-tab BroadcastChannel is renamed, so tabs on an older and a newer labkit stop hearing each other until both reload.
