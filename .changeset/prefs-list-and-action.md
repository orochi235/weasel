Four new built-in pref kinds: `list`, `map`, `union`, and `action`.

A `list` leaf holds an array whose entries are each described by `item`, an ordinary leaf: `{ kind: 'list', item: { kind: 'number', min: 0 }, minItems: 3, maxItems: 3 }`. The item may be any kind, built-in or app-defined, including an `object` or another `list`. A stored list reads entry by entry through the item, so one bad entry falls back to the item's default and the rest are kept; a list shorter than `minItems` reads as the default and one longer than `maxItems` is cut to it. `PrefValueOf` types a list by what its item holds.

A `map` leaf holds a record keyed by strings nobody declared, every value described by `item` as a list's entries are: `{ kind: 'map', item: { kind: 'number' } }` types as `Record<string, number>`.

A `union` leaf holds one of several object shapes, told apart by the string in its `tag` field. Each variant is an `object` leaf keyed by its tag value: `{ kind: 'union', tag: 'type', variants: { linear: {…}, radial: {…} } }` holds `{ type: 'linear', angle: 90 }`. Choosing a variant sets the value to that variant's default under its tag. A stored value whose tag names no variant reads as the default. `prefVariantOf` and `prefVariantDefault` are the two lookups. `PrefValueOf` types a union as each variant's fields under its tag, where the schema keeps `tag` a literal (`tag: 'type' as const`); with `tag` widened to `string` it is typed by its `default`, as before.

`repairPrefValue` now reads inside an `object` leaf: each field the stored object holds is read as its own leaf would be, so a number field is clamped and an enum field with an unknown option falls back to that field's default. A field the object omits stays omitted, and fields no leaf describes pass through. It used to accept any plain object whole. A union's variant and an object entry of a list or a map are read the same way.

An `action` leaf holds no value: it is a button among the rows that calls `run({ path })`, disabled while a promise `run` returned is pending. A store skips it, and its path is not a `PrefPath`. `prefHoldsValue(leaf)` tells the two sorts of leaf apart.

`PrefsForm`, `SelectionPanel`, and labkit's `ControlPanel` draw all four. A list is a `ListEditor` with one control per entry, drawn as the item leaf would be on a row of its own, and an entry of an app-defined kind goes to that kind's renderer. In `PrefsForm`, a list whose entries are objects or lists puts its label above the entries, which need the row's whole width. `PrefsForm` now does the same for a field of an `object` leaf, which used to show "no renderer" for an app-defined kind whether or not one was registered. `ListEditor` takes entries of any type through `renderEntry` and `newEntry`, and stops at `minItems` and `maxItems`. `PrefActionButton` is the action's button, exported for surfaces that draw their own rows. `MapEditor` draws a map as a key field and the item's control per entry, and `UnionPicker` a union as a select over the chosen variant's fields; both stack under the row's label.

`PrefControl` is one leaf's control as `PrefsForm` draws it, without the row: for a surface that lays out its own rows and has an object, a list, a map, or a union to put in one.

labkit: `f.list(default, item)` builds a typed list (`f.list([0, 1], f.number(0).range(0, 9))`), `.count(min, max)` bounds it, and `f.action(run)` builds a button. `f.list(strings)` is unchanged. An `f.value` whose default is an array of numbers or booleans is now inferred as a list of them; it used to throw. `f.object(fields)` builds one value with named fields (where `f.group` makes each field a leaf of its own), `f.map(default, item)` a record by arbitrary key, and `f.union(tag, variants)` one of several objects; each infers its config type. `ControlPanel` opens an object, a map, a union, and a list of anything but plain strings in a dialog from its row, drawn by `PrefControl`. An object leaf used to show "no control for object".

`PrefSchemaEditor` shows a list's or a map's `item` as a row under it in the structure tree, edited in the attributes pane like any leaf; it has no key to rename and cannot be removed or moved. A union's variants are rows under it: adding to a union adds an `object` leaf, and renaming a variant's key renames it in the union's default. A new action exports with `run: () => {}`, a stub to fill in, where it used to export `KEEP_FROM_SOURCE` with nothing in the source to keep.

**Breaking for anyone who registered a custom kind named `list`, `map`, `union`, or `action`:** those names are built-in now, and a `list` leaf needs an `item`. labkit's own `f.list` leaves carry one.
