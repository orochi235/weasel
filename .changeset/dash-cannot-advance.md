A dash whose entries are all zero, or that has a negative entry, strokes solid instead of hanging stroke tessellation. A dash with a NaN or infinite entry draws no stroke, and `@weasel-js/pdf` drops and reports the command holding it. `dashPattern` (`@weasel-js/paint`) is the one reading of a dash array that the tessellator, `strokeDashStyleOf` and the PDF writer share.
