A group or a section can be drawn `as: 'fragment'`: nothing of its own, so its rows sit among its neighbors' as though they were written there. It is for holding things together and no more: one key for their values to nest under, and one node to select, move or copy. It gets no heading, box, tab or rail entry, and at the top level its rows go on the root's own page. In a form two rows across, its rows take cells in the same grid as the rows around it.

`PrefsForm`, `SelectionPanel`, an `object` leaf's sections, and labkit's `ControlPanel` all draw it that way. Selected, it marks the rows it holds, having no box of its own to mark. `PrefSchemaEditor`'s palette makes one with a new Group tool, under the `</>` glyph, and the "Drawn as" choice lists it.

A group nested inside a fragment is drawn where the fragment is, as a section unless it says otherwise; it gets no rail entry of its own.
