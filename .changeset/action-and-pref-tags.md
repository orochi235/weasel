Actions and prefs carry `tags`: words they are also found by and gathered under. `Action.tags` and `ActionVariant.tags` (a variant carries its action's and its own, as `ActionItem.tags`); `tags` on every pref leaf, `PrefGroup`, and `PrefSection` (a leaf carries every group's above it). One matcher, `matchQuery` in `@weasel-js/registry`, now serves the command palette's search and `filterPrefSubtree`, so a query matches a tag as it matches a label, and `hasTag` is the exact test. Gathering by tag: `actionsTagged`, `taggedActionItems`, and `matchActionItem` (routing, re-exported by core), and `prefLeavesTagged` / `prefLeafTags` (prefs). `<ActionBar tag="…">` draws a bar from a tag in place of a `group`. A `CommandPalette` row found by a tag and not its label names that tag beside the label. The schema editor edits `tags` on leaves, groups, and sections. `flip` is tagged `mirror`. Additive.
