`@weasel-js/headless` holds the arithmetic of moving items within a list, which ui's reorderable lists, trees, bars, tabs and token fields and diagram's reorder drags and Alt+arrow step now share: `moveItems`, `movedIndex`, `isNoopDrop`, `nudgeGap`, `gapByMidpoint`, `nearestGap`, and the Alt+arrow chord `isNudgeChord`/`nudgeOf`. A destination is a gap counted before the moved items are taken out, and a selection of several items moves in one go.

ui's internal `movedOrder` now takes that gap rather than the entry's final index. A page tab no longer moves on Alt+Ctrl or Alt+Cmd with an arrow, only on Alt and an arrow, as every other reorderable list already did.
