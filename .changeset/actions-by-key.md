An action leaf fires a registered action by key. `PrefAction` gains `action`, the key of an action on the `ActionsRegistry` above the surface: its id, or `id:variant`. A leaf holding one is plain data, so a schema that carries it survives JSON. `run` is now optional and is what a leaf with no `action` calls. The leaf's `name` and `icon` are what the button shows; the registered action supplies the icon and shortcut the leaf lacks. A key the registry does not hold, or no registry, leaves the button dead. `PrefAction` also gains `control`: `'button'` reads the label, `'icon'` is the icon alone.

An action says whether it is held down. `Action` gains `active`, a predicate under the same contract as `enabled`, and `evaluateActive` reads it safely. A button drawn for the action sets `aria-pressed` from it. An action with no `active` has no pressed state.

`useLeafAction` answers for an action leaf on any surface. `BarAction` is the leaf as a toolbar cell, and `BarActionButton` is the button alone. `ActionBar` draws its entries with that button, so it now shows an active action as pressed. `PrefActionButton` draws through the same hook.
