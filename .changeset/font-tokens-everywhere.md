Text reads its family from the font tokens in more places.

- forge's index pages set their chrome and every story in `--wzl-font-ui`, and only the descriptions in `--wzl-font-body`. The whole page used to be set in the body face, so any story text that inherits its font — most of `SelectionPanel`, `Prefs`, `Tree`, `ItemList` — showed in Inter on the index page and in Oswald on the story's own page.
- `Slider`'s thumb labels and readouts, `ToolButton`'s shortcut, and the `Foundations` specimens read `--wzl-font-ui` / `--wzl-font-mono` instead of hard-coded font stacks.
- `NumberField`'s steppers, the property help button, `Timeline`'s transport buttons and `CurveField`'s actions take `font: inherit`. They are buttons, which don't inherit a font by default, so outside a host that resets form controls they rendered in the browser's own control font.
- labkit sets `code`, `kbd`, `samp` and `pre` inside `.lk-root` in `--wzl-font-mono`, at zero specificity. The browser's default `monospace` reaches no token.

`Keycaps` still sets its own sans stack: its stylesheet documents that as a deliberate exception.
