Breaking: `layoutRuns` no longer returns `groups` or `decorations`, and no longer takes `outlineMinSize`. It places glyphs and reads no paint; `paintRuns(laid, runs, { outlineMinSize })` derives what to draw for a layout and returns `{ groups, decorations }`.

```ts
const laid = layoutRuns(runs, opts);
const { groups, decorations } = paintRuns(laid, runs, { outlineMinSize });
```

`cachedPaintRuns` is the memoized form, beside `cachedLayoutRuns`. A layout's lines each carry `glyphs`, one `PlacedGlyph` per code point in visual order, which is what `paintRuns` and `textToPath` read. The `LaidOutGroup`, `LaidOutQuad`, `LaidOutOutlineGlyph`, and `LaidOutDecoration` shapes are unchanged, and groups still come in the order their first glyph appears.

The layout cache no longer keys on a run's fill, stroke, or decorations, or on the outline threshold, so two runs arrays that differ only there share one layout. It also survives a dynamic glyph bake landing: `faceGeneration()` in `@weasel-js/font` advances when faces change and holds still for a bake, where `glyphGeneration()` advances for both.

Paint identity is structural, and has one definition. `paintKey`, `strokeKey`, `fillHasInk`, and `strokeHasInk` are new in `@weasel-js/paint`. Two equal gradients built separately are one paint, so text runs filled with them share a group where each used to get its own. `textToPathsByPaint` now groups a zero-width or unpainted stroke with no stroke.

`@weasel-js/font` gains `metricsOf(resolved)`, the advances, kerning, and baseline of whichever tier a face resolved to, and `glyphIn` / `resolveGlyph`, which find one code point's glyph in that tier and then in the dynamic tier. Layout's missing-glyph and no-metrics warnings moved there and read `weasel:` where they read `weasel layoutRuns:`; `_resetFontRegistryForTests` and `_resetFallbackForTests` clear them. `@weasel-js/text/test-seams` gains `_resetBidiWarningForTests`.

Fixes:

- A run whose fill holds no paint (`fill: {}`) drew black from an atlas or the canvas tier. It now draws nothing, glyphs and decoration rules alike, as `fill: null` does.
- A run set in a canvas-tier family reported `drawsInk: true`, with no warning, for a code point its face could not rasterize. It now reports `false` and warns once, as an atlas run that escalates to the canvas tier does.
- A zero-advance glyph that escalated to the canvas tier was reported as missing until its bake landed.
- A family the registry had already warned "will not render at all" about got a second, no-metrics warning from layout.
- Text made only of Arabic-Indic digits or Arabic number signs triggered the "right-to-left characters but no `bidi` engine" warning, though it lays out the same with an engine.

Adds to the `@weasel-js/core` barrel: `paintRuns`, `cachedPaintRuns`, and the types `LaidOutCell`, `PlacedGlyph`, `PaintRunsOpts`, and `PaintedRuns`.
