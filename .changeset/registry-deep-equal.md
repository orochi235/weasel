New `deepEqual(a, b, { undefinedAsAbsent? })` in `@weasel-js/registry`: structural equality over arrays and plain objects from any realm, with every other value — a function, a class instance, a `Date` — equal only to itself. `undefinedAsAbsent` reads a key holding `undefined` as missing. `useCommand`, the schema editor's attribute aggregation, the selection panel's shared value, and text's range styles now all compare with it, in place of four private copies. Two of those copies compared a class instance field by field, and now compare it by identity: `useCommand`'s options and the schema editor's attribute values.
