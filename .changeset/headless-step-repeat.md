Holding a step chip on a `@weasel-js/hud` canvas menu's number row now repeats, as a `@weasel-js/ui` number field's steppers do: one step on the press, then after 400 ms one every 60 ms until release, until the pointer leaves the chip, or until the value reaches its bound. The step now comes on the press rather than the release. `attachMenuHost` and `createMenuWidget` take `repeat` to time it.

`@weasel-js/headless` exports `createStepRepeat`, the hold-to-repeat both run, with `REPEAT_DELAY_MS`, `REPEAT_EVERY_MS`, and `Scheduler` / `timerScheduler` for the clock it runs on; `@weasel-js/menu`'s `MenuScheduler` is now that `Scheduler`. `@weasel-js/quantity` exports `canSpin(key, from, bounds)`, whether a spin key moves a value anywhere, which `menuNumberCanStep` and `UnitField`'s steppers both use. This adds API.
