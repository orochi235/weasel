Every click-versus-drag decision in the kit now reads one threshold, `DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX` (4 CSS pixels), through `pastDragThreshold`. Both now live in `@weasel-js/gestures`; `@weasel-js/routing` and `@weasel-js/core` re-export them as before. `useDragHandle` starts a drag at 4px instead of past 5px, labkit's `FloatingPanel` and the hud window's content click at 4px instead of 3px, and `startThresholdDrag`, `useReorderDragList` and `Select` default to the constant rather than their own literal 4.

The move action's `dragThresholdPx` option works again: set as `selectTool.move.dragThresholdPx` on `<SceneCanvas>`, it holds the selection in place until the pointer has travelled that far on screen. It has been ignored since the `useMove` hook was removed. It cannot lower the threshold below the dispatcher's.
