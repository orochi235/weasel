### Minor Changes

- e7d71c9: Text properties: node-level typography through the schema-driven panel, and
  caret-range styling through a new tool options bar.

  `TextStyle` and `StyledRun` gain `letterSpacing`, `underline`, and
  `strikethrough`, with GL rendering, DOM-overlay, and SVG round-trips for all
  three. `styleAtRange` / `applyStyleToRange` expose the run algebra publicly,
  and `useTextEdit` gains `selection`, `rangeStyle`, and
  `applyStyleToSelection`. Text nodes get Character and Paragraph schema
  groups. New `ToolOptionsBar` component; `ToggleBar` renders indeterminate
  segments via `mixedValues`.

  Behavior changes worth knowing about:

  - **`SelectionPanel` reads and writes node paths of any depth** (two or more
    segments). It previously split at the first dot and read exactly one level,
    so `data.style.fontSize` resolved to `data['style.fontSize']`.
  - **The default `kit:text` painter paints a node's `runs`** when it has them,
    instead of re-flattening `data.text`. Run styling was previously invisible
    to anything drawn by the default scene layer.
  - **`useTextEdit` no longer commits when focus moves into editing chrome**
    (`isEditorChrome`), and commits on a pointerdown outside both the overlay
    and that chrome. Its published `selection` survives focus leaving the
    overlay — it clears on `startEdit` and when the edit ends. Without this a
    character bar could not exist: clicking its controls ended the edit they
    were there to change.
  - **The edit overlay can scale with the view** (`TextEditScreenPose.zoom`),
    keeping every metric on it — including run-level `fontSize` and
    `letterSpacing` — in world units. Omitting `zoom` keeps the old
    screen-pixel contract.
  - **The canvas-2D measurement path counts tracking**, as the GL path already
    did, so wrap points, `caretIndexAt`, and `fitTextPose` agree on tracked
    text. This moves wrap points on any text with a non-zero `letterSpacing`.
  - **The text tool enters edit on the box it inserts.**

  Breaking-ish, in packages that have not been published with these paths:

  - `splitNodePath` is removed from `@weasel-js/ui`'s public API — it was dead
    and encoded the superseded one-level path model. `nodeValueAt` and
    `setAtPath` are exported in its place.
  - A text node's color leaf is now `data.style.fill` of the new `paint` kind
    rather than `data.style.fill.color` of the `color` kind. `TextStyle.fill`
    is a tagged union, so the old leaf read `undefined` off a gradient and
    wrote a hybrid the renderer painted flat solid.
