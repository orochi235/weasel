- 514c34a: Document every public export at its definition site

  A JSDoc string now sits on each symbol reachable through a package's published
  entry points, in every package except `@weasel-js/ui`. Documentation only — no
  export was added, removed, renamed or reordered, and no behavior changed.

  `npm run audit:jsdoc` enumerates the public exports and reports which lack a
  docstring, so the claim can be re-derived rather than trusted.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 75ba7b1: Three fixes found by re-checking backlog entries against the code.

  SVG gradients survive a round trip. The parser now reads `gradientUnits`
  (`objectBoundingBox` → `units: 'bounds'`, `userSpaceOnUse` → `'world'`) and the
  serializer writes back whichever the paint declares, instead of hardcoding
  `userSpaceOnUse` on the way out — which had been reading a box-relative
  gradient's `0..1` geometry as page coordinates, i.e. a gradient the size of a
  pixel.

  `unpackSvgFiles` keeps gradient fills instead of flattening them to a solid.
  The reason recorded for the flattening — that the `kit:path` painter has no
  gradient slot — had not been true for some time; `NodeFill` is
  `string | FillStyle`, now exported. A `userSpaceOnUse` gradient is normalized
  against the leaf's own box on the way in, so it survives the fit-clamp and
  drop-point placement that move the geometry out from under it. Gradient
  _strokes_ still flatten: `data.stroke` genuinely is a color string.

  `extractUniformNames` skips precision and interpolation qualifiers. `uniform
highp float u_t;` — the common spelling in hand-written GLSL — matched nothing
  at all, so the uniform got no location and every write to it was dropped in
  silence. Comma-separated declarator lists (`uniform float a, b;`) read too.

  Also adds `tests/visual/text-decoration.spec.ts`, a baseline-free assertion
  that underline and strikethrough sit `0.40 em` apart and span only their own
  runs. It measures the gap between two gap-free horizontal ink runs, which is
  something `text.spec.ts`'s 5% diff tolerance cannot see move.

- 7decec1: Four more backlog fixes.

  `@weasel-js/svg` reads and writes `<image>`. A new `SvgImageNode` holds the
  `href` verbatim — an external URL or a `data:` URI, with `xlink:href` accepted
  on the way in — plus a box that inherited transforms collapse onto and an
  element-local rotation. `unpackSvgFiles` maps it onto the `kit:image` painter's
  `data.image.src`, so a dropped SVG carrying raster content now keeps it instead
  of dropping the element on parse. `preserveAspectRatio` is not modeled: the box
  is taken literally and written back as `none`, and a non-`none` source warns.

  `pickTopMostHit` resolves sibling z-order. An adapter can supply `getZIndex(id)`
  or `compareZ(a, b)`; both compose with the existing parent/child collapse rather
  than replacing it, so a child still beats its own ancestor whatever z the two
  report. Without either, the hit list's own order decides, as before.

  `useSceneTextEdit` supplies `setStyle`. Clearing a style flag that the _node_
  sets is the one edit the additive run algebra can't express, and `useTextEdit`
  declines it without a writer — so every scene-wired consumer silently refused
  that toggle. Override the projection with `setStyle(data, style)` for a
  non-default data shape.

  The slops debug overlay draws handle halos at the real hit radius. Affordance
  regions moved to screen-pixel radii, but this layer still scaled its circles by
  the view, so at 4x zoom it drew a 32px halo over an 8px target — the one thing
  a hit-test overlay must not do. Anchor slops now read the anchor radius rather
  than the handle radius.

- 24daa08: Five unrelated backlog fixes.

  The specificity tuple's `phase` dimension is graded rather than binary: an
  atom scores 2 when both its channel and its lifecycle state are concrete, 1
  when one axis is wildcarded, and 0 for `*:*`, which matches everything an
  undeclared phase would have matched. An atom list takes the minimum, since
  `matchPhase` is a union. No existing binding reorders — the four ambient
  actions hold at 1, and the polygon and star tools' `phase: 'engaged'` wheel
  bindings rise to 2, widening a gap they already won.

  The loupe's pixel mode no longer drops the end of a fast drag: a readback
  requested while `createImageBitmap` is in flight is remembered and re-run when
  that one settles, instead of being discarded.

  SVG unpack applies the fit-clamp to text on both axes. `fontSize` now scales
  with the file, and a text node's box width is estimated from its longest line
  instead of inheriting the parser's unbounded-width wrap sentinel — which,
  folded into the union AABB, had been clamping any external SVG containing
  text down to a speck. That sentinel is now the exported `UNBOUNDED_TEXT_WIDTH`
  rather than a bare `99999`, so a consumer reading `SvgTextNode.width` can tell
  a measurement from a placeholder.

  The debug overlay takes per-feature line widths and dashes through
  `DebugConfig.strokes`, alongside the colors `DebugConfig.theme` already
  carried. Defaults are unchanged.

  A `.dfont` face declines the outline tier by name. Datafork TrueType holds its
  sfnt tables inside a Macintosh resource map, which is still not unpacked, but
  it is now recognized before parsing and reported as itself rather than dying
  on an unrecognized-signature message that never says which format it saw.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 22eafe6: Pattern fills tile, persist, and round-trip through SVG.

  The `pattern` variant of `FillStyle` never tiled. `drawPathFillPattern`
  borrowed the `imageFill` program while binding the path fill mesh VAO, which
  enables `a_position` only — `a_uv` was never bound, so `v_uv` was the constant
  `(0, 0)` and every fragment sampled texel (0, 0) of the tile. Textures also
  uploaded with `CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, so correct UVs alone would have smeared rather
  than repeated. The variant had no visual consumer, which is why it went
  unnoticed.

  `patternFill` is now its own program, taking `gradFill`'s vertex stage:
  paint-space coordinates come from the screen position through `u_worldInv`
  rather than a UV attribute, so the path mesh keeps its position-only layout.
  `GLTextureCache.upload` takes a wrap argument and pattern textures bind
  `REPEAT`.

  Patterns pick up `units` alongside gradients. For a pattern it names the space
  the tile's **origin and scale** live in — not geometry, which a pattern hasn't
  got. `'bounds'` anchors the tile to the painted node's box, so dragging the
  node carries the pattern and resizing reveals more tiles instead of stretching
  them; `fillInPoseFrame` rebases it by translation only.

  `TilePatternSpec` is the serializable payload — plain data naming a built-in
  tile (`hatch`, `crosshatch`, `dots`, `chunks`) plus its parameters:

  ```ts
  { fill: 'pattern', pattern: { tile: 'hatch', color: '#0fb5a8', size: 8 }, units: 'bounds' }
  ```

  `resolvePatternSpec` turns one into a `TextureHandle` at paint time, memoized
  on the spec's values so identical specs share a texture. The built-in painters
  resolve it alongside `fillInPoseFrame`; a consumer emitting its own draw
  commands resolves it at the same place it calls that one. A `TextureHandle`
  payload still works untouched, but cannot be persisted or exported — prefer
  the spec.

  `@weasel-js/svg` serializes a tile spec as a `<pattern patternUnits=
"userSpaceOnUse">` whose children come from the same tile description that
  rasterizes the texture, so the vector and raster forms cannot drift. The spec
  rides along on `data-weasel-tile` for lossless re-import; a hand-authored
  `<pattern>` without it is dropped with a warning rather than guessed at.
  `SerializeOptions.onWarn` is new, and reports paint that SVG cannot express —
  a conic gradient, or a pattern carrying a `TextureHandle`.

  `tilePreviewSvg` / `tilePreviewCssUrl` render a single tile as a standalone
  `<svg>`, for pickers that need to show a tile outside a document.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e264d62: Stroked text.

  `TextStyle.stroke` and `StyledRun.stroke` carry a real `Stroke`, and the
  outline tier paints it as a second batched draw call over the group's merged
  geometry — so a glyph above `textOutlineMinScreenSize` gets real joins, caps
  and miters in any paint, because by then it is an ordinary `PolygonPath`.
  Width stays a world measure: it crosses into the cached em-space tessellation
  by dividing by the glyph's scale, so it does not grow with `fontSize`. Below
  the threshold a glyph is a sampled distance field with no geometry to stroke,
  and renders unstroked rather than approximated.

  `kit:text` also reads the kit-native `data.stroke` / `data.strokeWidth` leaf
  fields that `kit:shape` already honors, so one pair of stroke controls means
  the same thing on a text node as on a rect.

  `@weasel-js/svg` round-trips all of it — node-level and per-`<tspan>` — where
  it previously parsed a text stroke into a warning and dropped it.

  Two older bugs fell out of building it, both invisible to fills and both
  fixed: `extractPolylines` kept a closed contour's duplicate final point
  (zero-length closing segment, dropped wrap-around join), and glyph path data
  whose contours carried no `Z` stroked as open polylines — a missing closing
  edge with a cap at each loose end. A fill closes a contour implicitly; only a
  stroke reads the difference.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 8bc719a: Every package now declares `engines.node: ">=22"`, up from `">=20"`. Node 20
  reached end of life on 2026-04-30, so the old floor advertised support for a
  runtime that no longer receives security patches — a claim in each published
  tarball that had quietly stopped being true. `@weasel-js/labkit` had no `engines`
  field at all and now matches its siblings.

  Nothing in the kit required a Node 20 feature, so this changes what is promised
  rather than what runs. CI tests both ends of the range: the 22 floor and the 24
  Active LTS the release and docs workflows build on.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e7d71c9: Text properties: node-level typography through the schema-driven panel, and
  caret-range styling through a new tool options bar.

  `TextStyle` and `StyledRun` gain `letterSpacing`, `underline`, and
  `strikethrough`, with GL rendering, DOM-overlay, and SVG round-trips for all
  three. `styleAtRange` / `applyStyleToRange` expose the run algebra publicly,
  and `useTextEdit` gains `selection`, `rangeStyle`, and
  `applyStyleToSelection`. Text nodes get Character and Paragraph schema
  groups. New `ToolOptionsBar` component; `ToggleBar` renders indeterminate
  segments via `mixedValues`.

  Behavior changes worth knowing about:

  - **`SelectionPanel` reads and writes node paths of any depth** (two or more
    segments). It previously split at the first dot and read exactly one level,
    so `data.style.fontSize` resolved to `data['style.fontSize']`.
  - **The default `kit:text` painter paints a node's `runs`** when it has them,
    instead of re-flattening `data.text`. Run styling was previously invisible
    to anything drawn by the default scene layer.
  - **`useTextEdit` no longer commits when focus moves into editing chrome**
    (`isEditorChrome`), and commits on a pointerdown outside both the overlay
    and that chrome. Its published `selection` survives focus leaving the
    overlay — it clears on `startEdit` and when the edit ends. Without this a
    character bar could not exist: clicking its controls ended the edit they
    were there to change.
  - **The edit overlay can scale with the view** (`TextEditScreenPose.zoom`),
    keeping every metric on it — including run-level `fontSize` and
    `letterSpacing` — in world units. Omitting `zoom` keeps the old
    screen-pixel contract.
  - **The canvas-2D measurement path counts tracking**, as the GL path already
    did, so wrap points, `caretIndexAt`, and `fitTextPose` agree on tracked
    text. This moves wrap points on any text with a non-zero `letterSpacing`.
  - **The text tool enters edit on the box it inserts.**

  Breaking-ish, in packages that have not been published with these paths:

  - `splitNodePath` is removed from `@weasel-js/ui`'s public API — it was dead
    and encoded the superseded one-level path model. `nodeValueAt` and
    `setAtPath` are exported in its place.
  - A text node's color leaf is now `data.style.fill` of the new `paint` kind
    rather than `data.style.fill.color` of the `color` kind. `TextStyle.fill`
    is a tagged union, so the old leaf read `undefined` off a gradient and
    wrote a hybrid the renderer painted flat solid.
