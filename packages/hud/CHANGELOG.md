## 1.2.0

### Patch Changes

- daa5ce6: Add a source rect and flip to `ImageDrawCommand`, so one bitmap can be drawn as
  many frames.

  `source` is a sub-rectangle in bitmap pixels; `flipX` / `flipY` mirror the
  sampled region within the destination rect without moving the quad. Both are
  additive and optional — a command that sets neither draws exactly as before.
  Until now a sprite sheet needed a custom `ShaderDrawCommand` to do what is
  arithmetic on the quad's four UV pairs.

  `source` is not range-checked: a rect past the bitmap edge samples outside
  `[0..1]`, which `CLAMP_TO_EDGE` smears. With `sampling: 'linear'` the filter
  also reaches half a texel beyond `source`, so an atlas whose frames touch will
  bleed at the seams — pad frames with a gutter or use `'nearest'`. The renderer
  deliberately does not inset for this, which would make an exact 1:1 blit soft.

  New `frameRect(sheet, index)` and the `SpriteSheet` type turn a uniform grid
  (`frameWidth`, `frameHeight`, `columns`, optional `margin` and `spacing`,
  following the Tiled / Aseprite convention) into that source rect. It is
  row-major from 0 and does not wrap past the last cell — wrapping belongs to the
  animation, since a sheet does not know how many of its cells are filled.

  `@weasel-js/hud`'s image widget takes `source`, `flipX` and `flipY` as options
  and gains `setSource` and `setFlip` to change them in place. `setFlip` merges,
  leaving an omitted axis alone. Without the setters a sprite animation would
  have to dispose and rebuild the widget every frame.

- bab8191: Pick a color by clicking inside the loupe, and stop pixel mode from leaving a
  hole while it waits for its first readback.

  `createLoupe` gains `onPick` and `LoupeHandle.pick(p?)`: the color the lens is
  showing at a point, read off the framebuffer the same way the aim-point readout
  is. It maps the lens point back through the magnification — `loupeSourcePoint`
  inverts `loupeInnerView` — so picking near the edge of a 16× lens picks the
  pixel it draws there, not the one under the click. Where the color goes is the
  consumer's; WeaselDraw sends it to the focused swatch and the selection.

  A pick declines when the mapped point lands under the window itself, which can
  happen with the aim close alongside the frame: the framebuffer holds the window
  too, and reading there would report chrome as artwork.

  Telling that click from the drag is `WindowOptions.onContentClick`, new on the
  window widget — a press and release in the interior that never travelled more
  than a few pixels. A bare window's interior is also its move handle, so the two
  had to be separable before the loupe could take clicks at all.

  Pixel mode now paints the backdrop in every frame rather than only once a
  bitmap exists. Before the first readback settles — and whenever one comes back
  transparent — the lens had been painting nothing at all, which reads on screen
  as a window with the unmagnified canvas showing through it.

### Patch Changes

- 27b8e69: Correctness and keyboard fixes across `@weasel-js/ui` and `@weasel-js/hud`

  `Select` and `ComboBox` converted a controlled `selectedKey={null}` to
  `undefined`, which is React Aria's signal for _uncontrolled_. Clearing a
  selection therefore left the old value on screen and logged a
  controlled-to-uncontrolled warning. `SelectionPanel` hits this on every mixed
  enum property. Both now pass `null` through.

  `DataGrid`'s reorder hook measured rows against the wrapper `<div>`, whose only
  child is the `<table>`, so every drop reported the same index. The ref moves to
  `<tbody>`. Sortable headers become real buttons carrying `aria-sort`, and the
  drop indicator is a class on the target row rather than a hard-coded 28px
  offset.

  `useReorderDragList` treated the first locked row as a ceiling for the whole
  list, so a row _below_ a locked one could be dropped above it. A drop is now
  clamped to the run between the nearest locked rows either side of the grabbed
  row, and a multi-selection drops the members that sit past the wall.

  `Slider` ignored `constraint: 'ordered'` on the keyboard path — End sent a
  thumb straight past its neighbor. It also left its `document` listeners
  attached after `pointercancel` and after unmounting mid-drag, so a thumb kept
  tracking a released pointer, and a press did not focus the thumb the arrow keys
  are bound to.

  `BandEditor` had the same drag-teardown gap. Its `x` / `Delete` merge fired
  from anything inside a band — including typing `x` in a consumer's input and
  pressing Cmd+X — and its seams ignored Home/End.

  `GradientHandles` committed the mount-time handle position when a handle was
  clicked without moving, and committed the abandoned position on
  `pointercancel`. A press that never moves now writes nothing, a cancel restores
  the live preview, and the handles respond to the arrow keys. Their `role`
  drops from `slider`, which requires an `aria-valuenow` a 2-D position does not
  have, to `button`.

  `CurveEditor`'s `endpoints="pinned-both"` snapped an endpoint to the range
  corner on the first drag instead of holding it still.

  Every overlay the package renders into a portal — `ComboBox`, `Callout`,
  `Tooltip`, `Dialog`, alongside the `Select` popover that already did — carries
  `data-weasel-overlay`, the marker consumers use to ask whether focus left their
  component.

  In `@weasel-js/hud`: detaching left the hovered widget believing the pointer
  was still over it, and `hovermove` fired only on entry, so its `x`/`y` froze
  for the rest of the hover. The six widget factories ignored the detached-HUD
  guard `add()` enforces. `Widget` gains an optional `disposed` flag, which lets
  a loupe whose window is removed through the HUD stop reading pixels back and
  release its listener; `aimAt` after `dispose` is now a no-op.

### Patch Changes

- 514c34a: Document every public export at its definition site

  A JSDoc string now sits on each symbol reachable through a package's published
  entry points, in every package except `@weasel-js/ui`. Documentation only — no
  export was added, removed, renamed or reordered, and no behavior changed.

  `npm run audit:jsdoc` enumerates the public exports and reports which lack a
  docstring, so the claim can be re-derived rather than trusted.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 5fea43d: Five unrelated small fixes.

  A tapered stroke with `align: 'inner'` or `'outer'` on a polygon path painted
  at half its requested widths. That alignment renders by tessellating at twice
  the width and stencilling half away, and the doubling reached `stroke.width`
  but not `vertexWidths`. The doubled array is memoized per source array, since
  the ribbon cache compares it by reference.

  An image insert previews the decoded bitmap inside the drag bounds instead of
  committing on release with no preview at all. It falls back to the bare
  outline until the image decodes, and `useImageTool({ preview: 'outline' })`
  opts out of the bitmap entirely.

  A HUD widget that claims the pointer reports a `'pointer'` cursor without
  implementing anything — hovering one while a drawing tool was active used to
  keep showing that tool's cursor. The rule is keyed on the `claims` every
  widget already declares, so it covers consumer-authored widgets too;
  decoration claims nothing and the hit walk descends past it. A widget's own
  `cursorAt` still wins, and `button` takes a `cursor` option that feeds it.

  `composeAffordanceLayer`'s `hitTest` returns a `LayerHit`, carrying the hit
  region's declared cursor and claim instead of dropping them. `AffordanceRegion`
  gains optional `strength` / `claimedKinds` to declare that claim.

  `ToolPalette` uses the shared `useRovingTabIndex` rather than its own container
  handler, so arrow keys skip tools that are ineligible in the current mode and
  the tab stop no longer sits on one. `ToolButton` takes an `onKeyDown`.

- 24daa08: Five unrelated backlog fixes.

  The specificity tuple's `phase` dimension is graded rather than binary: an
  atom scores 2 when both its channel and its lifecycle state are concrete, 1
  when one axis is wildcarded, and 0 for `*:*`, which matches everything an
  undeclared phase would have matched. An atom list takes the minimum, since
  `matchPhase` is a union. No existing binding reorders — the four ambient
  actions hold at 1, and the polygon and star tools' `phase: 'engaged'` wheel
  bindings rise to 2, widening a gap they already won.

  The loupe's pixel mode no longer drops the end of a fast drag: a readback
  requested while `createImageBitmap` is in flight is remembered and re-run when
  that one settles, instead of being discarded.

  SVG unpack applies the fit-clamp to text on both axes. `fontSize` now scales
  with the file, and a text node's box width is estimated from its longest line
  instead of inheriting the parser's unbounded-width wrap sentinel — which,
  folded into the union AABB, had been clamping any external SVG containing
  text down to a speck. That sentinel is now the exported `UNBOUNDED_TEXT_WIDTH`
  rather than a bare `99999`, so a consumer reading `SvgTextNode.width` can tell
  a measurement from a placeholder.

  The debug overlay takes per-feature line widths and dashes through
  `DebugConfig.strokes`, alongside the colors `DebugConfig.theme` already
  carried. Defaults are unchanged.

  A `.dfont` face declines the outline tier by name. Datafork TrueType holds its
  sfnt tables inside a Macintosh resource map, which is still not unpacked, but
  it is now recognized before parsing and reported as itself rather than dying
  on an unrecognized-signature message that never says which format it saw.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 43482ce: A registry entry declares what it contributes and when it is eligible.

  `Contribution` is the entry type: `bindings`, `actions`, an `overlay`, a
  `presentation`, each optional and independent. `Tool<TScratch>` is now the
  **focus-declaring case** of one — it keeps only what a mode the user switches
  into needs (`initScratch`, the lifecycle hooks, the preview hooks, a `cursor`
  closing over its own scratch). An entry that only routes input declares only
  bindings and actions, which is what `@weasel-js/hud` always was.

  `Eligibility` is a set of conditions rather than one value, because one entry
  holds several: the hand tool is palette-selectable _and_ space-held. `focus`,
  `offhand: HotkeyTrigger`, `always`, `claimed`, plus `capabilities` as a modality
  filter — `@weasel-js/modes` now reads its tags from there. The scope tier a
  binding matches at is derived from whichever condition is live, ordered to match
  the dispatcher's existing hotkey > active > ambient walk. Nothing about that
  walk changed; what changed is that an entry lands in a tier because of what it
  declares about itself rather than which argument a consumer passed it in.

  `useContributions` is the assembly point, and `useTools` is a shim over it with
  its shape unchanged.

  **Breaking — `@weasel-js/hud`:** `createHudTool` / `useHudTool` are now
  `createHudContribution` / `useHudContribution`, with no alias. The old names were
  half of the same misstatement as the `as unknown as Tool<null>` cast they
  required; keeping them would preserve exactly what this corrects.

  **Breaking — `DispatcherContext.ambientToolIds` is removed.** A host driving the
  dispatcher directly declares `eligibility: { always: true }` on always-on entries
  instead. `useTools` consumers are unaffected; the shim sets it.

  **Behavior — a declared held-key trigger now wires itself.** `ToolDef.hotkey` was
  read by the inspector and wired nothing; the engagement lived in a host-side
  registration keyed by tool id (`BUILTIN_OFFHAND_ACTIONS`, now gone). Assembly
  registers the consolidated `tool.offhand` action from the declarations, so a tool
  that wants space declares it — `useHandTool` does. A host that also registered
  `tool.offhand` by hand should stop.

  **Behavior — `useTools` returns shallow copies** for ambient entries and
  `hotkey`-declaring tools, since it adds the declaration they were missing.
  Registry tools from `defineTool` are returned unchanged.

  **Behavior — route-conflict reporting now also sees action `defaultBinding`s.**
  The dispatcher always matched against them; the reporter never saw them, so a
  tool binding colliding with an action default went unreported. It no longer does.
  Dispatch is unchanged.

  Also added: `mergeContributions(...bundles)`, which concatenates and throws on a
  duplicate id rather than silently dropping one — the recorded plugin/bundling v1,
  whose deferral condition was "≥2 plugin-shaped features in flight."

  **Not done, so the seam is stated rather than implied:**
  `EligibilityState.heldTriggers` exists and `liveScope` honors it, but nothing
  populates it. `tool.offhand`'s invoker still reports engagement by pushing a tool
  _id_, which `engagedIds` reads, so the declaration registers the binding while
  the id carries the tier. Retiring that means changing `tool.offhand`'s contract.

### Minor Changes

- 8853e73: Affordance hits are claims, and an exclusive claim outranks the scope tier.

  `AffordanceHit` gains `strength`, and `owner` naming what produced the hit. Kit
  chrome claims `'shared'`, which is what it always did: compete on scope and
  specificity. Registered layers, whose hits previously flattened to a bare kind
  string and a payload, now return a `LayerHit` that can also carry `cursor` and
  `strength`, so a consumer's own chrome says the things kit chrome already said
  through `AffordanceRegion`. `owner` is groundwork — nothing binds on it yet, and
  today only diagnostics read it; target it with `kindOf` or `affordance:<kind>`.

  **Behavior change.** When a press carries an exclusive claim, only bindings
  whose `target` consults the affordance — a `kindOf` predicate, or the
  `affordance:<kind>` string form — are candidates. Scope ordering applies within
  that filtered set, unchanged. Body-class targets (`'empty'`, `'selected-body'`,
  `'unselected-body'`) and `kind:` targets resolve from the body classification
  and never see the affordance, so they no longer win presses on chrome floating
  over the body they name.

  This is the dispatcher rule the previous release's changeset said was the real
  fix. `select`'s marquee no longer needs its hand-written predicate declining
  chrome affordances, and it is deleted; `rect`, `ellipse`, `polygon`, `star`,
  `hand`, `pen` and `lasso` keep their bare `{ kind: 'drag' }` bindings and stop
  swallowing drags on HUD chrome anyway, which is the point — seven copies of a
  predicate was the alternative. (`select`'s _click_ binding keeps a predicate of
  its own, for an unrelated reason: resize and rotate bind only drag, so a click
  exactly on a handle would otherwise clear the selection.)

  The filter is hard: if an exclusive claim leaves nothing eligible, the press
  does nothing. A dev-only warning names the owner the first time that happens for
  each owner, because the failure is otherwise silent.

  **What a claim does not reach.** Only gestures that carry an affordance are
  filtered, and keyboard events never do. Which pointer-family gestures carry one
  is settled by the per-kind claim work later in this release — see "A widget
  declares which gestures it consumes." The filter outranks hotkey scope as well
  as active scope, so holding space to pan no longer pans while the pointer is
  over HUD chrome.

  `@weasel-js/hud` claims exclusively, and `Widget` gains `cursorAt(x, y)`, which
  resolves a cursor per point rather than from hover state; `hud.window()`
  implements it, so hovering a resize band shows `nwse-resize` instead of the
  active tool's cursor. A widget can also stay transparent to input — `rect`,
  `text`, `label` and `image` are decoration — so a backdrop widget no longer
  eats presses meant for the canvas or for widgets beneath it. That occlusion
  predates this release, but an exclusive claim would have widened it from "HUD
  elements occlude each other" to "HUD elements kill every tool underneath."

  `WindowWidget.cursor` is removed. Nothing read it; `cursorAt` replaces it.

- 40dd97d: A widget declares which gestures it consumes, and a claim bars only those.

  A HUD widget could be pressed, dragged and hovered and nothing else. The gap
  was in the dispatcher: `affordanceAt` ran on `pointerdown` and hover only, so
  `doubleclick`, `contextmenu` and `wheel` carried no affordance and no binding
  could gate on one. All four now do — `doubleclick` replays it from its press,
  `contextmenu` classifies its own position (a secondary button never reaches
  `onPointerDown`, so there is nothing to replay from) and gains world
  coordinates it never carried, and `wheel` classifies the point under the
  cursor. The immediate-invoker param bag, which forwarded position for `click`
  and `pointerdown` only, now covers `contextmenu`, `longpress` and the
  affordance on all four.

  **Behavior change, and the reason for the rest of this entry.** An exclusive
  claim previously meant _this pixel is mine_. Under that rule, giving `wheel` an
  affordance would have killed scroll-to-zoom over every floating panel. It now
  means _these gestures are mine_: `LayerHit` and `AffordanceHit` gain
  `claimedKinds`, a set over the new `ClaimableGesture` union (`'pointer'` —
  covering `pointerDown` / `click` / `drag`, one press protocol — plus
  `'doubleClick'`, `'contextMenu'`, `'longPress'`, `'wheel'`). Omitting it bars
  everything, which is what an exclusive claim did before.

  `Widget.claims` is that set. Absent means every kind but `wheel`, so
  right-clicking or double-clicking HUD chrome stops acting on the scene
  underneath while scroll-to-zoom over a panel is unchanged; a widget that wants
  the wheel asks for it. `claims: []` is decoration and replaces `claimsPointer`,
  which is removed. `HudPointerEvent` gains `doubleclick`, `contextmenu`,
  `longpress` and `wheel` arms.

  `PointerClaim` and `onPointer`'s return type are removed. The return was
  discarded at every call site, and it cannot be made live: the claim filter runs
  at match time, before any widget is consulted, so there is no later moment at
  which returning `'pass'` could restore a binding the filter already dropped.

  **Two matcher fixes this depends on.** `doubleClick` and `contextMenu` passed
  the DOM target to `matchTarget` where `click`, `drag` and `longPress` pass the
  affordance; a `kindOf` predicate on either kind therefore received an element
  no predicate in the kit expects. They now match the others. And the kit's body
  predicates — `isBody`, `isSelectedBody`, `isUnselectedBody`, `isEmpty` — carry
  `readsAffordance: false`, which `targetConsultsAffordance` honors. Each has a
  `kindOf` but reads only `bodyTarget`, so the filter inferred that they consult
  the hit and let them survive a claim; with `doubleclick` now carrying one,
  `enterPathEdit`'s `kindOf: isBody` would otherwise have entered path-edit mode
  on a double-click over chrome.

  `WheelSpec` gains `target`, and `wheel` gains a route-grammar target slot —
  a wheel binding could not gate on anything at all before.

- 531150f: A loupe, and the window primitive it needed.

  `hud.window()` is a draggable, resizable frame drawn in WebGL over the canvas —
  titlebar, eight resize bands, close box. It paints no interior. Interiors come
  from a new optional `content` painter on `Widget`, which `attachHud` draws
  beneath every widget frame in the same layer, clipped to `contentRect`. That
  painter receives `HudContentCtx`, carrying the scene data and view the hud layer
  was already handed; `HudDrawCtx` stays data-free, so widgets remain renderable
  headlessly. Painter commands are in absolute canvas coordinates — the group
  carries a clip, not a transform.

  `createLoupe()` is the first consumer: a window whose interior shows either the
  scene re-rendered through a magnified inner view, or the actual framebuffer read
  back and magnified 1:1. Both modes exist because neither answers both questions
  honestly — a re-render is crisp at any magnification but its antialiased edge
  colors are not the colors on screen, so the hex readout samples the framebuffer
  in either mode. The frame stays parked and the pointer aims it; content freezes
  while the pointer is over the window, which is what keeps the borders reachable.
  Aiming uses its own `pointermove` listener rather than hud hover, because hud
  hover comes from the layer's `onUncapturedMove` and stops during a captured drag
  — exactly when a magnifier is most wanted.

  Also fixed in the HUD: `hud.drag` pumped **world** coordinates into widgets
  while `hud.press` sent screen coordinates, because the dispatcher builds
  move/end contexts with an empty dep bag and the `view` lookup silently fell
  through. Invisible at zoom 1, and a window that jumped and tracked backwards at
  any other zoom. The drag action now captures its deps at gesture start.

  `ImageDrawCommand` gains `sampling: 'linear' | 'nearest'`, applied per draw at
  bind time rather than at upload, since `GLImageCache` keys textures by bitmap
  identity. Without `nearest`, magnifying a framebuffer readback comes back
  blurred, which defeats the readback.

  **Behavior change in `@weasel-js/core`:** the select tool's area-select drag now
  declines presses that a registered layer's hit-test claimed. It bound
  `{ kind: 'drag', target: 'empty' }`, and the string form of `target` resolves
  from the body only — chrome floating over empty canvas read as empty canvas, so
  area-select swallowed drags on HUD widgets. The adjacent `clearSelection` click
  binding already had the correct shape. Other tools that bind a bare
  `{ kind: 'drag' }` still have this hole.

- 6855465: Themes are values you can define, extend, and apply.

  `defineTheme` / `resolveTheme` / `applyTheme` / `loadDTCG`, plus a React
  binding at `@weasel-js/theme/react`. A theme extends the built-in one by
  default, so a partial theme can't be incomplete; overriding a primitive
  rebases every alias that references it. `applyTheme` stamps data attributes
  and adopts a rule block rather than writing inline properties, so the cascade
  still does the work and per-subtree overrides are just a different theme name.

  The WebGL HUD no longer reads CSS custom properties through
  `getComputedStyle`. It receives the same resolved record the stylesheet was
  built from, which also makes headless rendering themeable for the first time.
  `readTokens` and `ResolvedTokens` are gone from `@weasel-js/hud`; use
  `ResolvedTheme` and pass a theme to `attach`.

  The sixteen deprecated `--wzl-*` aliases are removed (264 call sites migrated).
  Three were never aliases and became real semantics: `--wzl-fg-inverse`,
  `--wzl-surface-hover`, `--wzl-surface-pressed`.

### Minor Changes

- d3e5597: Extract the MSDF glyph tier into a new `@weasel-js/font` package: font
  registry, atlas parsing, glyph layout, runtime rasterization, and the SDF
  text shader source. `@weasel-js/core` depends on it; `registerFont` is still
  re-exported from `@weasel-js/core/renderer`, so existing call sites keep
  working.

  Unregistered font families now render in the default family with a one-time
  warning instead of rendering nothing. Configure with
  `setFontFallbackPolicy('substitute' | 'canvas' | 'none')` — `'none'`
  restores the previous hard-miss behavior, and `'canvas'` rasterizes the real
  typeface at runtime when the browser has it. A family the `'canvas'` policy
  enrolled for itself stops being canvas-served once the policy changes; one
  you name with `registerCanvasFont` is served under every policy, and
  `isCanvasFont` reports that distinction — it answers "will the dynamic tier
  serve this family right now", so an auto-enrolled family reads `false` under
  `'substitute'` and `'none'`. The default
  family may be a canvas-registered family, and when it cannot serve the
  request either, the resulting blank text is reported with its own warning
  naming the default family rather than failing silently. Requesting the
  default family itself also warns — whether it is registered at a variant it
  can't serve, or `setDefaultFontFamily` named a family that was never
  registered at all; either way there is nothing left to fall back to. An app
  that has registered no fonts and set no default stays silent, since that is
  not a misconfiguration.

  `ResolveResult.substituted` reports the substitution structurally, and
  `ResolveResult.resolved` now
  carries the matched `family` alongside `weight` and `style` — the full atlas
  identity to pass to `getFont` / `textureCacheKey`.

  Adds `listFonts()` for enumerating registered families.

### Patch Changes

- 5a741be: Ship the TypeScript declarations that `ui` and `hud` already advertised.

  `@weasel-js/ui@0.5.0` and `@weasel-js/hud@0.5.0` were published with no `.d.ts`
  files at all, while their `exports` maps pointed `types` at `./dist/index.d.ts`.
  Consumers got an implicitly-`any` module.

  Both packages build as `vite build && tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`. Vite's
  `emptyOutDir` deletes the declarations the previous run emitted, but tsc's
  `--incremental` state (inherited from the repo root) still recorded them as
  emitted, and plain `--incremental` compares input signatures without checking
  whether the outputs are still on disk. So every build after the first emitted
  nothing and exited 0. A cold CI checkout only ever builds once, which is why
  this never went red. Their declaration builds are no longer incremental.

  Two gates now cover the class rather than the instance: `npm run check:manifests`
  refuses to publish a package whose `exports`/`types` map names a file that
  `npm pack` would not include, and the consumer smoke test type-imports both
  packages so a missing declaration surfaces as TS7016.
