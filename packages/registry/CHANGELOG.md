### Patch Changes

- a028cc3: New package `@weasel-js/registry`: `createReflectable()` is a keyed store a registry embeds to hand out a uniform read-only `Reflection` — `get`, `has`, `entries()`, `subscribe` and `getVersion`, shaped for `useSyncExternalStore`. Each entry reports the registrant's `source` and the registrants it displaced (`shadowed`), so overrides of one key show up as conflicts.
  
  The kit's module-level registries now expose one: `paintKindRegistry`, `markerRegistry`, `opFactoryRegistry`, `fontRegistry`, `fontOutlineRegistry` (which also notifies as a face's load state moves), and, from `@weasel-js/core/renderer`, `programSourceRegistry` and `textureRegistry`. `ModeRegistry` gains `reflection`. Built-in paint kinds and markers report `source: 'kit'`.
  
  Fixes paint-kind and marker overrides disposed out of order: with two overrides of one id, disposing the earlier and then the later used to restore the already-disposed earlier one instead of the built-in. Overrides now stack, and each disposer removes only its own entry.
