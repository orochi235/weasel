### Patch Changes

- 304f53a: Actions and prefs carry `tags`: words they are also found by and gathered under. `Action.tags` and `ActionVariant.tags` (a variant carries its action's and its own, as `ActionItem.tags`); `tags` on every pref leaf, `PrefGroup`, and `PrefSection` (a leaf carries every group's above it). One matcher, `matchQuery` in `@weasel-js/registry`, now serves the command palette's search and `filterPrefSubtree`, so a query matches a tag as it matches a label, and `hasTag` is the exact test. Gathering by tag: `actionsTagged`, `taggedActionItems`, and `matchActionItem` (routing, re-exported by core), and `prefLeavesTagged` / `prefLeafTags` (prefs). `<ActionBar tag="…">` draws a bar from a tag in place of a `group`. A `CommandPalette` row found by a tag and not its label names that tag beside the label. The schema editor edits `tags` on leaves, groups, and sections; its structure, settings, unplaced, and action trees find rows by tag through the same matcher; and an `EditorAction` carries its registered action's tags, shown among what the registry says of the action a pref fires. `flip` is tagged `mirror`. Additive.
- 63b310c: Icons are named, not drawn, by the code that uses them. This is breaking.
  
  `@weasel-js/icons` is new. An icon is a qualified name, `namespace:name` (`core:undo`, `ui:close`, `path-tools:reversePath`), held as an `IconRef`. Each package's `icon()` makes one and qualifies its own bare names: in core, `icon('undo')` is `core:undo`. A registry supplies the glyphs: mount `<IconRegistryProvider icons variants>` from `@weasel-js/core` at the app root, or give `<WeaselProvider>` its new `icons` and `iconVariants` props. Core, ui and path-tools each publish their table at `./icons` (`import { icons } from '@weasel-js/ui/icons'`). A name no registered table holds draws a placeholder and warns in development, and draws nothing in production.
  
  `@weasel-js/icons-plugin` is new too. Its build plugin, `weaselIcons`, ships only the glyphs a build names. In an app's vite, rollup or rolldown build, `weaselIcons.vite({ mode: 'app' })` serves `virtual:weasel-icons`, holding the glyphs named by the app and by the weasel packages it imports, and fails the build on a name no table holds. `virtual:weasel-icons/all`, `/<namespace>` and custom variants each load as their own chunk, asked for with `useIconVariant(name)`. Types for the virtual modules are at `@weasel-js/icons-plugin/virtual`. The plugin is its own package so that installing `@weasel-js/icons` does not install a native parser. Core's and ui's `dist` is no longer minified, so the `@icon` annotations the plugin reads survive; a consumer's bundler minifies.
  
  What breaks:
  
  - routing: `Action.icon`, `ActionVariant.icon`, `ActionItem.icon` and `ToolPresentation.icon` take an `IconRef` from `icon()`, not a React node. So does `useCommand`'s `icon` option, which no longer takes a function read each time the command shows.
  - prefs: `PrefBase.icon` and an enum option's `icon` take an `IconRef`, not a free string. A schema saved with bare names, such as `"icon": "close"`, now draws nothing for them and warns in development; write `"ui:close"`.
  - core, ui and path-tools: the `…Icon` components are removed; draw `<Icon name={icon('core:rect')} />` instead. `NudgeAnchorsIcon` and its `dir` prop become four glyphs, `core:nudgeAnchors` (pointing right), `core:nudgeAnchorsUp`, `core:nudgeAnchorsDown` and `core:nudgeAnchorsLeft`. Core's `PaintKindEntry.icon` and `PaintKindFamily.icon` take an `IconRef`. Core's `ACTION_GLYPHS`, `IconProps` and `ActionGlyphProps` are gone, and so are ui's `ICON_PATHS`, `ICON_FILLS`, `ICON_GROUPS`, `MARK_ICONS`, `IconName`, `MarkIconName`, `FillableIconName` and `ActionIconSource`.
  - ui: `<Icon name>` and `mark`, `actionIcon` and `ActionBar`'s `icons` take `IconRef`s, and `isFillable` takes a glyph. `resolveIcon` draws a ref, or a qualified string read from data. `iconFromData(value)` reads a name from data as a ref, warning once in development about a bare one.
  - labkit: `CommandItem`, `ToolItem`, `ViewportControl` and `TrialTool` take an `IconRef` as `icon`, and so does `ConfigOption.icon`. `IconComponent`, the nine ui icon components labkit re-exported, and its `ICON_PATHS` and `IconName` are gone.
  - forge: `GlobalDeclaration.icon` takes an `IconRef`. `FrameSetup.icons` registers an app's own tables in every frame. A story's `control.icons` argTypes option takes qualified names (`'ui:statusSuccess'`); a bare `'statusSuccess'` now draws nothing.
  
  `@weasel-js/registry` exports `isDev()`, which `@weasel-js/react` re-exports. It reads `process.env.NODE_ENV`, which a production bundle folds to `false`, and the development diagnostics in core, routing, ui, labkit, renderer and animator all read it.
- 1be2ea9: New `deepEqual(a, b, { undefinedAsAbsent? })` in `@weasel-js/registry`: structural equality over arrays and plain objects from any realm, with every other value — a function, a class instance, a `Date` — equal only to itself. `undefinedAsAbsent` reads a key holding `undefined` as missing. `useCommand`, the schema editor's attribute aggregation, the selection panel's shared value, and text's range styles now all compare with it, in place of four private copies. Two of those copies compared a class instance field by field, and now compare it by identity: `useCommand`'s options and the schema editor's attribute values.

## 1.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 886380f: Each README's "API reference" link now opens the package's page on the site, `https://orochi235.github.io/weasel/#pkg/<name>`, where it used to open the TypeDoc site at `/weasel/api/`, which is no longer built. A file comment that sat on an `export { … }` list is now marked as the file's, so an entry's description no longer shows up as the summary of each function the entry re-exports. No code changed. `@weasel-js/labkit` drops `vitepress` from its devDependencies, which nothing used.

## 1.10.0

### Patch Changes

- 27b827e: text: the run algebra lives here now: `styleAtRange`, `applyStyleToRange`, `patchRangeStyle`, `effectiveRangeStyle`, `rangeWeight`, `setFlagOverRange`, `nodeHasFlag`, and `unboldPatch`, with the `RangeStyle`, `RunStylePatch`, `StyleKey`, `FlagKey`, and `SetFlagResult` types. `runsCarryStyling` and `supersededKey` are exported beside them. None of them needed a scene. The `MIXED` sentinel and its `Mixed` type moved to `@weasel-js/registry`, and text exports them too. `@weasel-js/core` still exports every name it did before.
- ee08fa5: Adds API: `Reflectable.release(key, registrant)` removes exactly one registrant from a key's stack, live or shadowed, whether `push` or `set` wrote it, and returns whether it was there. Removing the live one uncovers the one beneath. It shares one removal path with the function `push` returns, so releasing by either makes the other a no-op.
  
  Adds API: `ReflectedEntry.live` is the registrant holding the key. It is the same frozen object in every snapshot, and the one `shadowed` lists once something displaces it, so a row drawn from `reflection.entries()` can hand any registrant it shows straight to `release`. `value` and `source` stay on the entry as they were.

## 1.9.4

### Patch Changes

- 001aaae: `@weasel-js/registry` exports `createEmitter()`, one subscribe/notify pair with stated semantics: a pass calls the listeners held when it began, one unsubscribed before its turn is skipped, and a listener that throws is reported to `console.error` without stopping the others or throwing into the store. The reflectable registry, modes' scoping layer and decorations, and core's pose overrides, pose feed, layout reflow, parallax plane, and key state are built on it. For those stores, a listener that subscribes during a notify now waits for the next one, and a throwing listener no longer aborts the notify.
- 4d559ca: `isPlainObject` lives in `@weasel-js/registry` (core still exports it), and `@weasel-js/geom` exports a scalar `clamp(v, lo, hi)`. theme, prefs, labkit, and forge read plain objects through the one realm-safe test, so a `Date` or a `Map` no longer passes where they accept a record; ui's Slider and ResizeHandle, hud's loupe, and labkit's ZoomControl use geom's clamp. When its bounds cross, ResizeHandle now holds to `min` where it held to `max`. theme and prefs gain a dependency on registry, and ui's on geom moves from dev to runtime.

### Patch Changes

- a028cc3: New package `@weasel-js/registry`: `createReflectable()` is a keyed store a registry embeds to hand out a uniform read-only `Reflection` — `get`, `has`, `entries()`, `subscribe` and `getVersion`, shaped for `useSyncExternalStore`. Each entry reports the registrant's `source` and the registrants it displaced (`shadowed`), so overrides of one key show up as conflicts.
  
  The kit's module-level registries now expose one: `paintKindRegistry`, `markerRegistry`, `opFactoryRegistry`, `fontRegistry`, `fontOutlineRegistry` (which also notifies as a face's load state moves), and, from `@weasel-js/core/renderer`, `programSourceRegistry` and `textureRegistry`. `ModeRegistry` gains `reflection`. Built-in paint kinds and markers report `source: 'kit'`.
  
  Fixes paint-kind and marker overrides disposed out of order: with two overrides of one id, disposing the earlier and then the later used to restore the already-disposed earlier one instead of the built-in. Overrides now stack, and each disposer removes only its own entry.
