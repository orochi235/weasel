### Patch Changes

- 27b8e69: Correctness and keyboard fixes across `@weasel-js/ui` and `@weasel-js/hud`

  `Select` and `ComboBox` converted a controlled `selectedKey={null}` to
  `undefined`, which is React Aria's signal for _uncontrolled_. Clearing a
  selection therefore left the old value on screen and logged a
  controlled-to-uncontrolled warning. `SelectionPanel` hits this on every mixed
  enum property. Both now pass `null` through.

  `DataGrid`'s reorder hook measured rows against the wrapper `<div>`, whose only
  child is the `<table>`, so every drop reported the same index. The ref moves to
  `<tbody>`. Sortable headers become real buttons carrying `aria-sort`, and the
  drop indicator is a class on the target row rather than a hard-coded 28px
  offset.

  `useReorderDragList` treated the first locked row as a ceiling for the whole
  list, so a row _below_ a locked one could be dropped above it. A drop is now
  clamped to the run between the nearest locked rows either side of the grabbed
  row, and a multi-selection drops the members that sit past the wall.

  `Slider` ignored `constraint: 'ordered'` on the keyboard path — End sent a
  thumb straight past its neighbor. It also left its `document` listeners
  attached after `pointercancel` and after unmounting mid-drag, so a thumb kept
  tracking a released pointer, and a press did not focus the thumb the arrow keys
  are bound to.

  `BandEditor` had the same drag-teardown gap. Its `x` / `Delete` merge fired
  from anything inside a band — including typing `x` in a consumer's input and
  pressing Cmd+X — and its seams ignored Home/End.

  `GradientHandles` committed the mount-time handle position when a handle was
  clicked without moving, and committed the abandoned position on
  `pointercancel`. A press that never moves now writes nothing, a cancel restores
  the live preview, and the handles respond to the arrow keys. Their `role`
  drops from `slider`, which requires an `aria-valuenow` a 2-D position does not
  have, to `button`.

  `CurveEditor`'s `endpoints="pinned-both"` snapped an endpoint to the range
  corner on the first drag instead of holding it still.

  Every overlay the package renders into a portal — `ComboBox`, `Callout`,
  `Tooltip`, `Dialog`, alongside the `Select` popover that already did — carries
  `data-weasel-overlay`, the marker consumers use to ask whether focus left their
  component.

  In `@weasel-js/hud`: detaching left the hovered widget believing the pointer
  was still over it, and `hovermove` fired only on entry, so its `x`/`y` froze
  for the rest of the hover. The six widget factories ignored the detached-HUD
  guard `add()` enforces. `Widget` gains an optional `disposed` flag, which lets
  a loupe whose window is removed through the HUD stop reading pixels back and
  release its listener; `aimAt` after `dispose` is now a no-op.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 3641641: New component: `BandEditor` divides a numeric axis into contiguous bands and
  lets you drag the seams between them. Each band carries a payload the consumer
  supplies and renders through `renderBand`, so the control never learns what a
  band means.

  The axis is always fully covered — N bands, N−1 interior seams, no gaps and no
  overlaps — which makes editing a partition the same thing as editing a sorted
  seam list. Seams clamp at their neighbours instead of crossing, so no drag can
  destroy a band: removal is only ever the explicit merge (`x` / `Delete`, into
  the left neighbour, whose payload survives). The first band's left edge is
  `min` and does not move, and it has no left neighbour to merge into, so a
  partition always keeps at least one part.

  `scale` takes `'linear'`, `'log'` or a `BandScale` of your own, and defaults to
  `'log'` because the interesting part of a width axis is usually its narrow end.
  A log scale needs `min > 0`; given anything else the component falls back to
  linear and warns once in development rather than positioning every seam at
  `NaN`.

  `onInput` fires live during a drag and `onChange` once per committed gesture,
  following `GradientHandles`. `Slider` uses the opposite sense (`onChange` live,
  `onCommit` committed) — a known inconsistency in this package that this change
  deliberately leaves alone.

  Nothing existing changed. The added exports are `BandEditor`, `BandEditorProps`,
  `Band`, `BandScale`, `linearScale` and `logScale`.

- 51aae33: Document every public export of `@weasel-js/ui` with a JSDoc string at its
  definition site, so editor hover and the generated API reference say what each
  component, prop bag and helper is for.

  No behavior, names or exports changed. Where a component's live-versus-committed
  callback pair is spelled differently from its neighbors' — `Slider`'s
  `onChange`/`onCommit` against `GradientEditor`'s `onInput`/`onChange` — the
  docstring records which sense that component uses rather than smoothing it over.

- 917359a: `@weasel-js/ui` now spells the live/committed callback pair one way, on every
  control that has both: **`onInput` fires continuously through a gesture, and
  `onChange` fires once when it commits.**

  Four components move to it. `ColorField`, `GradientEditor` and
  `GradientHandles` already used this sense and are unchanged.

  | Component      | was (live / committed)        | now                    |
  | -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | `Slider`       | `onChange` / `onCommit`       | `onInput` / `onChange` |
  | `ResizeHandle` | `onChange` / `onChangeEnd`    | `onInput` / `onChange` |
  | `CurveEditor`  | `onChange` / `onChangeCommit` | `onInput` / `onChange` |
  | `PointPlotter` | `onChange` / `onChangeCommit` | `onInput` / `onChange` |

  Four spellings had grown up, and two of them disagreed about what `onChange`
  meant — so a reader who learned `Slider` guessed `ColorField` backwards. The
  surviving pair is the DOM's own: `input` fires while you type or drag, `change`
  when the edit is done. It also means a single-callback control like `ToggleBar`
  keeps `onChange` with commit semantics intact.

  **Migrating is a rename, but `onChange` still compiles while meaning something
  new, so read this before running a codemod.** On the four components above,
  `onChange` used to be the live callback and is now the committed one. Passing a
  live handler to `onChange` type-checks and then only fires on release. The
  committed names (`onCommit`, `onChangeEnd`, `onChangeCommit`) are gone, so those
  fail loudly; the live rename is the one to do by hand.

  Behavior is unchanged, including which callback is required: these four are
  fully controlled, so `onInput` is required (without it the control freezes
  mid-drag) and `onChange` is optional. `ColorField` and `GradientEditor` buffer
  internally and keep the opposite. Required-ness follows the control's state
  model, not the naming.

  `CurveEditor`'s layer-gesture `onCommit(state, ctx)` is a different protocol and
  is untouched.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 9639d92: `ActionsBar` and `OptionsBar` now share one stylesheet,
  `components/segmentedControl.module.css`, instead of keeping byte-identical
  188-line copies each. The two look the same and differ only in what a segment
  does, so the styles had two places to stay in sync and no mechanism keeping
  them there.

  No visual or API change: same rules, same class names, same generated output.
  The merged stylesheet is the same size either way — identical content already
  collapsed to a single scoped hash — so this buys maintainability, not payload.

  `ToggleBar` keeps its own copy. It carries the same base plus a `segmentMixed`
  third state and a deliberately different `variant_minimal`, and folding those
  together needs a decision about whether the three bars are one component.

- 5fea43d: Five unrelated small fixes.

  A tapered stroke with `align: 'inner'` or `'outer'` on a polygon path painted
  at half its requested widths. That alignment renders by tessellating at twice
  the width and stencilling half away, and the doubling reached `stroke.width`
  but not `vertexWidths`. The doubled array is memoized per source array, since
  the ribbon cache compares it by reference.

  An image insert previews the decoded bitmap inside the drag bounds instead of
  committing on release with no preview at all. It falls back to the bare
  outline until the image decodes, and `useImageTool({ preview: 'outline' })`
  opts out of the bitmap entirely.

  A HUD widget that claims the pointer reports a `'pointer'` cursor without
  implementing anything — hovering one while a drawing tool was active used to
  keep showing that tool's cursor. The rule is keyed on the `claims` every
  widget already declares, so it covers consumer-authored widgets too;
  decoration claims nothing and the hit walk descends past it. A widget's own
  `cursorAt` still wins, and `button` takes a `cursor` option that feeds it.

  `composeAffordanceLayer`'s `hitTest` returns a `LayerHit`, carrying the hit
  region's declared cursor and claim instead of dropping them. `AffordanceRegion`
  gains optional `strength` / `claimedKinds` to declare that claim.

  `ToolPalette` uses the shared `useRovingTabIndex` rather than its own container
  handler, so arrow keys skip tools that are ineligible in the current mode and
  the tab stop no longer sits on one. `ToolButton` takes an `onKeyDown`.

  - @weasel-js/modes@1.0.2

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 75e15ca: `useRovingTabIndex` — the arrow-key focus behavior `ActionsBar`, `OptionsBar`,
  and `ToggleBar` each implemented separately, now one hook they share (and one
  `@weasel-js/ui` exports, re-exported through `@weasel-js/labkit/weasel-ui`).
  It handles the tab stop, arrow/Home/End navigation with disabled items skipped
  and wrap-around at both ends, and optional selection-follows-focus for
  radiogroup-style bars. Its docs say when a bar should _not_ use it: a
  container of arbitrary compound controls has to leave the arrow keys to those
  controls, which is why `ToolOptionsBar` still doesn't have one.

  No keyboard behavior changed in any of the three bars.

  - @weasel-js/modes@1.0.1

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 9ed1139: Gradient fills that stay attached to their shape, and an editor for them.

  Gradient geometry was interpreted in screen space: `draw.ts` set the shader's
  `u_worldInv` to the identity matrix, with a comment saying a later step would
  wire the real view inverse. Nothing did. Every gradient therefore slid across
  its own geometry under pan and zoom, which is why the gradient demo shipped
  with pan and zoom disabled. Fine for a viewport-fixed wash, useless for a
  paint on a shape.

  Gradient paints now carry `units`, mirroring SVG's `gradientUnits`:

  - `'bounds'` — fractions of the painted node's box, `0..1` per axis (SVG
    `objectBoundingBox`). Resolved by the node painter, so the paint follows the
    node through moves, resizes and rotation.
  - `'local'` — the frame the geometry was handed to the renderer in.
  - `'world'` — scene coordinates; the paint holds still while geometry moves
    through it (SVG `userSpaceOnUse`).
  - `'screen'` — surface pixels, and the default, so every existing gradient
    keeps the behavior it had. WeaselDraw's workspace tint wants exactly this.

  `WeaselRenderer.render` takes an optional view matrix for `'world'`, and falls
  back to screen space without one. `fillInPoseFrame` resolves `'bounds'` against
  a box and `fillToBoundsFrame` inverts it; `mat3.invert` is new alongside them.
  Supporting helpers: `sampleGradientStops`, `withGradientKind`,
  `gradientGeometry`, `gradientForBounds`.

  `setFill` takes a whole `paint` as well as a `color`, so a gradient edit is one
  undo entry like any color edit. A `color` no longer tries to inherit alpha from
  a fill that is a gradient.

  New in `@weasel-js/ui`: `<GradientEditor>` (kind switch, stop strip, per-stop
  color) and `<GradientHandles>` (on-canvas endpoint / center / radius / angle
  handles, positioned through consumer-supplied `toScreen` / `toLocal` so it
  needs no view or scene of its own). Both split live `onInput` from committed
  `onChange`.

  Converting between kinds is lossy in ways the data makes unavoidable: a radial
  gradient stores no angle, so a round trip through one leaves the segment
  horizontal, and a conic stores no radius, so a round trip through one resets
  the segment's length.

  `'bounds'` is not a frame you can do polar math in: `x` and `y` are fractions
  of two different lengths, so a circle in it is an ellipse on screen.
  `<GradientHandles>` therefore takes a gradient already resolved by
  `fillInPoseFrame`, and consumers convert edits back with `fillToBoundsFrame`.

### Patch Changes

- 6855465: Themes are values you can define, extend, and apply.

  `defineTheme` / `resolveTheme` / `applyTheme` / `loadDTCG`, plus a React
  binding at `@weasel-js/theme/react`. A theme extends the built-in one by
  default, so a partial theme can't be incomplete; overriding a primitive
  rebases every alias that references it. `applyTheme` stamps data attributes
  and adopts a rule block rather than writing inline properties, so the cascade
  still does the work and per-subtree overrides are just a different theme name.

  The WebGL HUD no longer reads CSS custom properties through
  `getComputedStyle`. It receives the same resolved record the stylesheet was
  built from, which also makes headless rendering themeable for the first time.
  `readTokens` and `ResolvedTokens` are gone from `@weasel-js/hud`; use
  `ResolvedTheme` and pass a theme to `attach`.

  The sixteen deprecated `--wzl-*` aliases are removed (264 call sites migrated).
  Three were never aliases and became real semantics: `--wzl-fg-inverse`,
  `--wzl-surface-hover`, `--wzl-surface-pressed`.

### Patch Changes

- 8bc719a: Every package now declares `engines.node: ">=22"`, up from `">=20"`. Node 20
  reached end of life on 2026-04-30, so the old floor advertised support for a
  runtime that no longer receives security patches — a claim in each published
  tarball that had quietly stopped being true. `@weasel-js/labkit` had no `engines`
  field at all and now matches its siblings.

  Nothing in the kit required a Node 20 feature, so this changes what is promised
  rather than what runs. CI tests both ends of the range: the 22 floor and the 24
  Active LTS the release and docs workflows build on.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- d22624c: `Select` rows now carry a `textValue`, derived from a string label or the
  new per-option `textValue` for labels built from elements. Every row draws a
  check mark beside its label, so React Aria could never read a string off the
  children — it warned once per row on every open, and type-to-select did
  nothing.
- 6af4806: `@weasel-js/font` gains `listCanvasFonts()`, the enumeration companion to
  `isCanvasFont`. Families served by the dynamic canvas-SDF tier could only be
  queried one at a time, so a font picker had no way to offer them without
  hard-coding a list beside the `registerCanvasFont` calls. Reports service
  rather than membership, matching `isCanvasFont`: an auto-enrolled family
  appears only while the `'canvas'` fallback policy is in force.

  `@weasel-js/ui`'s `Select` marks its portalled popover with
  `data-weasel-overlay`. A consumer asking "did focus leave my component?" via
  `closest()` gets the wrong answer for portalled DOM — a text editor whose
  font menu is a `Select` ended its edit session the moment the menu was
  clicked, discarding the style patch that click was making.

- 6df0f1e: Add `StatusBar` (with `StatusBarItem` / `StatusBarSpacer`) and `ResizeHandle`
  — the two pieces of editor shell that every app was otherwise rebuilding.
  `ResizeHandle` is the window-splitter pattern: pointer drag or arrow keys,
  `role="separator"` with a live value range, snapping to a `step` grid so
  fractional pointer coordinates don't leak into persisted layouts. Both are
  layout-agnostic; the consumer still owns the shell.
  - @weasel-js/modes@0.7.1

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e7d71c9: Text properties: node-level typography through the schema-driven panel, and
  caret-range styling through a new tool options bar.

  `TextStyle` and `StyledRun` gain `letterSpacing`, `underline`, and
  `strikethrough`, with GL rendering, DOM-overlay, and SVG round-trips for all
  three. `styleAtRange` / `applyStyleToRange` expose the run algebra publicly,
  and `useTextEdit` gains `selection`, `rangeStyle`, and
  `applyStyleToSelection`. Text nodes get Character and Paragraph schema
  groups. New `ToolOptionsBar` component; `ToggleBar` renders indeterminate
  segments via `mixedValues`.

  Behavior changes worth knowing about:

  - **`SelectionPanel` reads and writes node paths of any depth** (two or more
    segments). It previously split at the first dot and read exactly one level,
    so `data.style.fontSize` resolved to `data['style.fontSize']`.
  - **The default `kit:text` painter paints a node's `runs`** when it has them,
    instead of re-flattening `data.text`. Run styling was previously invisible
    to anything drawn by the default scene layer.
  - **`useTextEdit` no longer commits when focus moves into editing chrome**
    (`isEditorChrome`), and commits on a pointerdown outside both the overlay
    and that chrome. Its published `selection` survives focus leaving the
    overlay — it clears on `startEdit` and when the edit ends. Without this a
    character bar could not exist: clicking its controls ended the edit they
    were there to change.
  - **The edit overlay can scale with the view** (`TextEditScreenPose.zoom`),
    keeping every metric on it — including run-level `fontSize` and
    `letterSpacing` — in world units. Omitting `zoom` keeps the old
    screen-pixel contract.
  - **The canvas-2D measurement path counts tracking**, as the GL path already
    did, so wrap points, `caretIndexAt`, and `fitTextPose` agree on tracked
    text. This moves wrap points on any text with a non-zero `letterSpacing`.
  - **The text tool enters edit on the box it inserts.**

  Breaking-ish, in packages that have not been published with these paths:

  - `splitNodePath` is removed from `@weasel-js/ui`'s public API — it was dead
    and encoded the superseded one-level path model. `nodeValueAt` and
    `setAtPath` are exported in its place.
  - A text node's color leaf is now `data.style.fill` of the new `paint` kind
    rather than `data.style.fill.color` of the `color` kind. `TextStyle.fill`
    is a tagged union, so the old leaf read `undefined` off a gradient and
    wrote a hybrid the renderer painted flat solid.

### Patch Changes

- @weasel-js/modes@0.7.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `./components/*` subpath exports, so a consumer can import one component
  instead of the whole barrel:

  ```ts
  import { ToolPalette } from "@weasel-js/ui/components/ToolPalette";
  import { ToastRegion, toast } from "@weasel-js/ui/components/Toast";
  ```

  This needed a build change, not just an `exports` entry: the package built as a
  single `dist/index.js`, so there was nothing for a subpath to point at. The Vite
  build now emits one entry per component directory, keyed to mirror the source
  tree — which is also where `tsc --emitDeclarationOnly` already put the matching
  `index.d.ts`, so a single `*` wildcard lines up the JS and the types, and a
  component added later is reachable with no further change.

  Code shared between entries is hoisted into `dist/chunks/` rather than copied
  into each, so module-level state stays single: importing the barrel and a
  subpath in the same app yields one `defaultToastQueue`, not two.

### Patch Changes

- @weasel-js/modes@0.6.0

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 5a741be: Ship the TypeScript declarations that `ui` and `hud` already advertised.

  `@weasel-js/ui@0.5.0` and `@weasel-js/hud@0.5.0` were published with no `.d.ts`
  files at all, while their `exports` maps pointed `types` at `./dist/index.d.ts`.
  Consumers got an implicitly-`any` module.

  Both packages build as `vite build && tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`. Vite's
  `emptyOutDir` deletes the declarations the previous run emitted, but tsc's
  `--incremental` state (inherited from the repo root) still recorded them as
  emitted, and plain `--incremental` compares input signatures without checking
  whether the outputs are still on disk. So every build after the first emitted
  nothing and exited 0. A cold CI checkout only ever builds once, which is why
  this never went red. Their declaration builds are no longer incremental.

  Two gates now cover the class rather than the instance: `npm run check:manifests`
  refuses to publish a package whose `exports`/`types` map names a file that
  `npm pack` would not include, and the consumer smoke test type-imports both
  packages so a missing declaration surfaces as TS7016.
