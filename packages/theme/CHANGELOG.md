## 1.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 2d30a32: A theme redefined under a name it already used now replaces its CSS

  `applyTheme` cached emitted rules on `theme.name::mode` and skipped anything
  already seen. `defineTheme` takes a caller-supplied name and enforces no
  uniqueness, so an edit-and-reapply — a module re-evaluated by HMR, a theme
  editor rebuilding its theme — produced a new `Theme` under the same name and
  was swallowed as a cache hit, pinning the first token values for the life of
  the page.

  The cache now holds the rule text it published for each key and republishes
  when it differs. Rewriting the sheet rather than appending keeps it the size
  of the theme set, so a theme reapplied under one name cannot stack rules.

  `resolveTheme` consequently runs on every `applyTheme` call rather than once
  per name. That call happens when the theme or mode changes, not per frame.

### Patch Changes

- 514c34a: Document every public export at its definition site

  A JSDoc string now sits on each symbol reachable through a package's published
  entry points, in every package except `@weasel-js/ui`. Documentation only — no
  export was added, removed, renamed or reordered, and no behavior changed.

  `npm run audit:jsdoc` enumerates the public exports and reports which lack a
  docstring, so the claim can be re-derived rather than trusted.

### Minor Changes

- 5debfac: labkit's theming collapses into the shared system.

  **Breaking.** `@weasel-js/labkit/theme-light.css` and
  `/theme-interstellar.css` are gone, and so are the 42 `--lk-*` custom
  properties — component styles read `--wzl-*` now. `<Lab>` and `<LabShell>`
  take `mode` (`"auto" | "light" | "dark"`) instead of `theme`
  (`"auto" | "light" | "interstellar"`); a stored `"interstellar"` preference
  hydrates as `"dark"`. `LabTheme` is now `LabMode`, and the store's `setTheme`
  is `setMode`.

  `interstellar` is exported as a `Theme` value — authored as a DTCG document,
  loaded through `loadDTCG`, extending the built-in theme. It overrides values
  only: labkit's font weights, radius and glass blur differ from weasel's, and
  `extends` rebases everything else.

  Fixes three sets of references that had no definition and silently fell back
  to hardcoded light-mode values or to nothing, which is why `LayerList`,
  `Palette`, `DragGhost`, `ControlPanel` and `CanvasStack` did not follow the
  theme.

  `@weasel-js/theme` gains the token groups labkit contributed: a four-step
  spacing scale, three z-layer constants, a ten-color categorical swatch set,
  `--wzl-backdrop`, `--wzl-control-h`, `--wzl-glass-blur`, `--wzl-radius-lg`,
  `--wzl-font-size`, `--wzl-font-size-sm` and `--wzl-font-weight-medium`.
  `ThemeProvider` accepts `className` and `style`, so its wrapper can be the
  consumer's own layout element instead of an extra div inside it.

- 6855465: Themes are values you can define, extend, and apply.

  `defineTheme` / `resolveTheme` / `applyTheme` / `loadDTCG`, plus a React
  binding at `@weasel-js/theme/react`. A theme extends the built-in one by
  default, so a partial theme can't be incomplete; overriding a primitive
  rebases every alias that references it. `applyTheme` stamps data attributes
  and adopts a rule block rather than writing inline properties, so the cascade
  still does the work and per-subtree overrides are just a different theme name.

  The WebGL HUD no longer reads CSS custom properties through
  `getComputedStyle`. It receives the same resolved record the stylesheet was
  built from, which also makes headless rendering themeable for the first time.
  `readTokens` and `ResolvedTokens` are gone from `@weasel-js/hud`; use
  `ResolvedTheme` and pass a theme to `attach`.

  The sixteen deprecated `--wzl-*` aliases are removed (264 call sites migrated).
  Three were never aliases and became real semantics: `--wzl-fg-inverse`,
  `--wzl-surface-hover`, `--wzl-surface-pressed`.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d5cdc4: Design tokens are generated from a DTCG source.

  `packages/theme/tokens/` is now the only hand-edited token artifact. One
  generator emits `tokens.css`, the TS theme objects, the `TokenName` union, and
  the Storybook token manifest, replacing a hand-written stylesheet, a
  hand-mirrored `DEFAULT_TOKENS` object, and two separate regex parsers that each
  re-derived the token list from CSS on disk. A determinism test fails if the
  committed output drifts from the source.

  The `color-mix()` tokens (`--wzl-line*`, the button hover/pressed fills) are now
  computed exactly on the JS side instead of being, per the old file's own header,
  "plausible hex approximations". CSS output still emits `color-mix()` so a
  downstream override of the referenced token keeps tinting.

  Modes are selected with `data-wzl-mode` (was `data-theme`), and are declared
  per-theme in the DTCG source rather than as hand-restated selector blocks.

  Oswald and Inter now ship with the package under OFL 1.1 and load via a new
  opt-in `@weasel-js/theme/fonts.css` entry; `tokens.css` no longer `@import`s a
  stylesheet from `fonts.googleapis.com`. labkit consumes the same font files
  instead of its own copy — which it had been publishing with no license file,
  no `OFL.txt`, and no attribution — and gains the `LICENSE` it was missing. Its
  `@font-face` also no longer declares a `100 900` weight axis; Oswald's real
  range is `200 700`.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 8bc719a: Every package now declares `engines.node: ">=22"`, up from `">=20"`. Node 20
  reached end of life on 2026-04-30, so the old floor advertised support for a
  runtime that no longer receives security patches — a claim in each published
  tarball that had quietly stopped being true. `@weasel-js/labkit` had no `engines`
  field at all and now matches its siblings.

  Nothing in the kit required a Node 20 feature, so this changes what is promised
  rather than what runs. CI tests both ends of the range: the 22 floor and the 24
  Active LTS the release and docs workflows build on.
