## 1.12.0

### Patch Changes

- fb09495: `engines.node` now reads `>=22.12.0`, the floor its `oxc-parser` dependency declares. Node 22
  releases before 22.12 were never supported; the manifest said they were.

## 1.11.1

### Patch Changes

- ecd8f59: Walk the parsed module with the plugin's own walker over oxc-parser's `visitorKeys` instead of
  oxc-parser's `Visitor`, which loads its walker with `require()` of an ES module. That load failed
  under vitest's vm pools on Node 22, so any test importing the plugin's collector or rewriter
  there threw `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'`.
- f819e61: Breaking for anyone naming ui's shape glyphs: the plain shapes move out of `@weasel-js/ui` into `@weasel-js/icons`, under a namespace of their own, so `ui:shapeHexagon` is now `shape:hexagon`, and every package may name them without depending on ui. Their table is `@weasel-js/icons/shapes`, and ui's `kitIcons` includes it. There is one new glyph, `shape:trapezoidSide`, a trapezoid on its side with its narrow end west.
  
  `ToolPalette` takes `columns`, which lays each group out as a grid that many buttons across, and `onToolDragStart`, which makes each button a drag source. `ToolGroup` takes `columns`, and `ToolButton` takes `onDragStart`.
  
  A `DiagramStencil` takes an `icon`, its tool's palette glyph, and each of `FLOWCHART_STENCILS` has one.
  
  `@weasel-js/icons-plugin` reads a workspace package's source table when the table its manifest declares is not built yet.

## 1.11.0

### Patch Changes

- 63b310c: Icons are named, not drawn, by the code that uses them. This is breaking.
  
  `@weasel-js/icons` is new. An icon is a qualified name, `namespace:name` (`core:undo`, `ui:close`, `path-tools:reversePath`), held as an `IconRef`. Each package's `icon()` makes one and qualifies its own bare names: in core, `icon('undo')` is `core:undo`. A registry supplies the glyphs: mount `<IconRegistryProvider icons variants>` from `@weasel-js/core` at the app root, or give `<WeaselProvider>` its new `icons` and `iconVariants` props. Core, ui and path-tools each publish their table at `./icons` (`import { icons } from '@weasel-js/ui/icons'`). A name no registered table holds draws a placeholder and warns in development, and draws nothing in production.
  
  `@weasel-js/icons-plugin` is new too. Its build plugin, `weaselIcons`, ships only the glyphs a build names. In an app's vite, rollup or rolldown build, `weaselIcons.vite({ mode: 'app' })` serves `virtual:weasel-icons`, holding the glyphs named by the app and by the weasel packages it imports, and fails the build on a name no table holds. `virtual:weasel-icons/all`, `/<namespace>` and custom variants each load as their own chunk, asked for with `useIconVariant(name)`. Types for the virtual modules are at `@weasel-js/icons-plugin/virtual`. The plugin is its own package so that installing `@weasel-js/icons` does not install a native parser. Core's and ui's `dist` is no longer minified, so the `@icon` annotations the plugin reads survive; a consumer's bundler minifies.
  
  What breaks:
  
  - routing: `Action.icon`, `ActionVariant.icon`, `ActionItem.icon` and `ToolPresentation.icon` take an `IconRef` from `icon()`, not a React node. So does `useCommand`'s `icon` option, which no longer takes a function read each time the command shows.
  - prefs: `PrefBase.icon` and an enum option's `icon` take an `IconRef`, not a free string. A schema saved with bare names, such as `"icon": "close"`, now draws nothing for them and warns in development; write `"ui:close"`.
  - core, ui and path-tools: the `…Icon` components are removed; draw `<Icon name={icon('core:rect')} />` instead. `NudgeAnchorsIcon` and its `dir` prop become four glyphs, `core:nudgeAnchors` (pointing right), `core:nudgeAnchorsUp`, `core:nudgeAnchorsDown` and `core:nudgeAnchorsLeft`. Core's `PaintKindEntry.icon` and `PaintKindFamily.icon` take an `IconRef`. Core's `ACTION_GLYPHS`, `IconProps` and `ActionGlyphProps` are gone, and so are ui's `ICON_PATHS`, `ICON_FILLS`, `ICON_GROUPS`, `MARK_ICONS`, `IconName`, `MarkIconName`, `FillableIconName` and `ActionIconSource`.
  - ui: `<Icon name>` and `mark`, `actionIcon` and `ActionBar`'s `icons` take `IconRef`s, and `isFillable` takes a glyph. `resolveIcon` draws a ref, or a qualified string read from data. `iconFromData(value)` reads a name from data as a ref, warning once in development about a bare one.
  - labkit: `CommandItem`, `ToolItem`, `ViewportControl` and `TrialTool` take an `IconRef` as `icon`, and so does `ConfigOption.icon`. `IconComponent`, the nine ui icon components labkit re-exported, and its `ICON_PATHS` and `IconName` are gone.
  - forge: `GlobalDeclaration.icon` takes an `IconRef`. `FrameSetup.icons` registers an app's own tables in every frame. A story's `control.icons` argTypes option takes qualified names (`'ui:statusSuccess'`); a bare `'statusSuccess'` now draws nothing.
  
  `@weasel-js/registry` exports `isDev()`, which `@weasel-js/react` re-exports. It reads `process.env.NODE_ENV`, which a production bundle folds to `false`, and the development diagnostics in core, routing, ui, labkit, renderer and animator all read it.
- 34f8b09: The plugin's source writes the `.ts` extension on every relative import, so vite's native config loader can load a config that imports it from source. The published bundle is unchanged.
- 285b0e7: Under `vite build --watch`, each rebuild now ships the glyphs its own modules name and reads every table afresh, instead of keeping every name and table an earlier build saw. A name deleted from the source no longer ships, and deleting one from both the source and its table no longer fails the rebuild.
  
  Library mode annotates a recorded icon name in whichever chunk its literal lands, so a constant the bundler inlined into another chunk keeps its `@icon` annotation. The build now fails when any such literal has lost its annotation, not only when every one has, and names the ones that did.
  
  A namespace import, a default import, or a re-export of `icon` from an `icons.gen` module now warns: the plugin does not follow those, so their calls go unrewritten.
  
  The dev server finds a table in a directory named `fixtures`, which it used to skip, and a package that ships a `dist/package.json` with no `name` is read from its real root, so its declared table is found.
