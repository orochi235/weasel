### Patch Changes

- bfe6a4f: `contrastLineColor(background, strength)` derives a line color that reads against an arbitrary background — a grid or a rule drawn over a page whose color the document picks, where theme tokens follow the chrome instead. It moves the background `strength` in OKLab lightness away from its nearer end, darker over light and lighter over dark, keeping its hue, so dark and tinted pages get lines that show. Re-exported from `@weasel-js/core`.
- b1c30bc: The hud `window` takes a `stance` and a `tone`, like the kit's DOM panels, with `setStance` / `setTone` to change them. It draws them in WebGL from the resolved theme: the stance's `--wzl-stance-<stance>-<slot>` values restyle its fill, border and title, and the tone mixes into the fill in oklab. A numeric tone indexes the theme's tone list through the new `HudDrawCtx.toneAt`, which `attachHud` builds from its new `tones` option and `useHud` fills from the app's `<ThemeProvider>`. A widget drawn by hand, as in a test, now needs a `toneAt` in its draw context.
  
  `@weasel-js/theme` adds `resolveStanceSlots`, the stance lookup for a surface drawn without the cascade. `@weasel-js/paint` adds `mixOklab`, which matches CSS `color-mix(in oklab, …)`, alpha included.
- 9aa63a1: A `Palette` type: named entries whose colors are literals in any color space (`{ space, coords, alpha? }`), refs to other entries or to an outside lookup (`{ ref, index? }`), or functions computed at resolve time. An entry may instead hold `colors`, a factory such as a `function*` that yields a sequence, possibly endless, read lazily. `resolvePaletteColor` follows refs to a literal, `resolvePaletteColors` iterates one entry, and `colorLiteralToHex` converts `srgb`, `oklab` and `oklch` literals to hex.

### Patch Changes

- 24a2dae: Close the places where two tiers spelled one concept differently.
  
  **A fixed pan bug.** `viewport.dragPan` fell back from `drag.screenDelta` to
  the world `drag.delta` and then divided by the zoom anyway, panning at
  1/scale² for any event source that supplies no `clientX`/`clientY` — which is
  every synthesized `InputEvent`, since those fields are optional. It now
  reconstructs the client delta exactly, by undoing each end of the world delta
  against the view that produced it.
  
  **Breaking, renames.** `ClickEvent`, `DoubleClickEvent` and `ContextMenuEvent`
  carry their world point as `x`/`y`, matching every other kind in `InputEvent`;
  `worldX`/`worldY` are gone, and a consumer who set `x`/`y` no longer silently
  lands at the origin. All three now also carry `clientX`/`clientY`, so a
  context-menu action can finally read `ctx.screen` — the case that surface was
  added for. The renderer's `Mat3` is `GlMat3`, freeing `Mat3` to mean geom's
  affine in a file that imports from both. `translatePolygonInPlace` is
  gone: it was the one sanctioned writer into a committed path's coord buffer,
  documented as overlay-only, and nothing called it. `@weasel-js/font` exports `FontStyle`
  in place of `OutlineFontStyle`. `@weasel-js/labkit` no longer exports
  `useOrbit`, `OrbitView`, `Vec3` or their helpers: `@weasel-js/kernel3d` owns
  the orbit camera and `@weasel-js/geom/3d` owns `Vec3`. `ToolCtx.screenPoint`
  was declared and never written by anything; it is gone.
  
  **Breaking, types narrowed.** geom's `Mat3` and `Box` are readonly tuples,
  matching the reason `geom/3d` already gives for its own. `History.entries()`
  returns `readonly` arrays, which is what its docstring always asked callers to
  assume.
  
  **One type where there were two.** `@weasel-js/svg`'s `Matrix` is geom's
  `Mat3`, and its duplicate `multiply` is geom's; `SvgStroke.width` is
  `ScreenLength` rather than that union written out again. `kernel3d`'s
  `ViewportRect` is `ScreenBox` — one rectangle spelling instead of `w`/`h`
  beside `width`/`height` eight lines apart. The renderer's `View` is routing's.
  Core's `Vec2` is routing's `Point2`, and `Pt` is gone from the barrel.
  
  **Additions.** `oklchDegToHex` / `hexToOklchDeg` / `OklchDeg` in
  `@weasel-js/paint` — the degrees-and-hex form `@weasel-js/ui` and
  `@weasel-js/theme` had each built for themselves. `srgbFloatToOklab`, for
  callers holding 0..1 floats; feeding those to `srgbU8ToOklab` truncated where
  paint's own internal conversion rounds. `mat3.toAffine` / `mat3.fromAffine`
  name the repack between the GL layout and geom's.
  
  **Corrections.** `RECT_POSE_DESCRIPTOR` implements `getRotation`, so a pose it
  rotated no longer reports itself unrotated to `useResize` and to diagram's port
  placement. `ToolDef.capabilities` is documented as reaching
  `Tool.eligibility.capabilities`, which is where it actually goes — following
  the old text gave `undefined`, and `eligibleForMode` turns that into a tool
  that vanishes from every mode. `MultitouchEvent.centroid` is documented as
  canvas-local, which is what the dispatcher hands over. `drag.points` is a
  snapshot on `onEnd` rather than the dispatcher's live accumulator.
  
  `tsconfig.json` now typechecks `packages/routing`, `cursor`, `bidi` and
  `loupe`, which it had never included.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- f644eac: The sRGB ↔ OKLab/OKLCH conversions (`srgbU8ToOklab`, `oklabToOklch`, `lerpOklch` and the rest) now live in `@weasel-js/paint`. `@weasel-js/core` still exports every one of them, so no import changes.
- 626bace: A gradient now names the space its stops blend through. `interpolate` on any of
  the three gradient kinds takes `'rgb'` (the default, and what every other vector
  format means by a gradient), `'oklab'`, or `'oklch'` — which travels around the
  hue wheel, so red to blue stays saturated instead of passing through a muddy
  purple. Alpha is linear in every space.
  
  The blend is paid for once, in the 256-texel ramp the shader samples, so a
  perceptual gradient costs a batched frame nothing over an sRGB one. The space is
  part of the ramp atlas key: the same stops under two spaces take two rows.
  
  `sampleGradientStops` and `sampleResolvedStops` take the space as a third
  argument, `bindRamp` as an optional third, and `GradientEditor` grows an
  sRGB / OKLab / OKLCh switch (`spaceSwitch={false}` hides it). `@weasel-js/svg`
  writes `wzl:interpolate` on the gradient's own element and reads it back; a
  renderer that ignores it still paints the gradient, in sRGB.
- b981856: Accept `{ px }` screen-pixel sizes for `fontSize` and `letterSpacing`
  
  `TextStyle.fontSize`, `TextStyle.letterSpacing` and their `StyledRun`
  counterparts now take `number | { px: number }`, the spelling `Stroke.width`
  and `MarkerRef.size` already had. A `{ px }` size holds its on-screen size as
  the view zooms, so a label no longer divides by the view scale at the call
  site.
  
  The unit is one type and one resolver now: `ScreenLength` and
  `resolveScreenLength` live in `@weasel-js/paint`, which both core and text
  already depend on, and `resolveStrokeWidth` delegates to it.
  
  Resolution happens at the entry to layout, not at draw time. A screen-pixel
  size changes the glyph advances and so the wrap points and the measured
  bounds, so `resolveTextStyle`, `resolveRuns`, `textPoseLayoutInput`,
  `layoutTextPose`, `measureTextBounds` and the three command builders
  (`textCommand`, `textCommandFromRuns`, `textCommandFromPose`) each take the
  view scale, defaulting to 1. `ResolvedTextStyle` and `ResolvedRun` keep plain
  world numbers, so everything downstream is unchanged.
  
  `createTextLayer` passes the mean of `view.scale.x` and `view.scale.y`, so
  non-scene text gets this with no consumer change. The `kit:text` node painter
  deliberately does not: it memoizes on `(data, pose)` to keep the renderer's
  layout cache hitting across frames, and keying that on the live camera would
  miss on every zoom frame.
  
  SVG serialization writes a `{ px }` size as that many user units — SVG user
  space has no camera — and the fit clamp on import leaves one alone, since a
  screen-pinned size is not the file's to scale.

## 1.4.3

### Patch Changes

- fc16cac: `Stroke.paint` is optional, and a stroke without one paints nothing everywhere
  rather than throwing.
  
  Such a stroke is real: a property panel that writes one field onto a node with
  no stroke — a width, a cap — materializes a whole stroke around it, and
  documents written before that was fixed still hold them. The painters already
  read one as no stroke. Every other reader dereferenced `paint` unguarded, so a
  document holding one threw on SVG export, on copy, and out of any consumer
  painter or overlay whose command reached the renderer directly.
  
  The type says so now, which is what stops the next reader from assuming
  otherwise. What each one does with an unpainted stroke:
  
  - The renderer skips the stroke pass and paints the fill.
  - The SVG serializer emits no `stroke` attributes at all, the way it already
    does for an absent or zero-width stroke.
  - Text layout keys it as no stroke, so an unpainted run groups with unstroked
    ones instead of splitting a draw call, and does not get pulled onto the
    outline tier to stroke nothing.
  - `setStrokeOpacity` seeds the default stroke color to have something to set an
    opacity on, keeping the width and joins already there.

### Patch Changes

- 94f2446: Add stroke markers — arrowheads and other line terminators as stroke style.
  
  `markerStart` / `markerMid` / `markerEnd` on `Stroke` take a key resolved
  through a new registry (`registerMarker`), shipping eight built-in shapes.
  Unlike SVG, the stroke stops short of a filled head rather than running under
  it to the tip; the distance is declared per marker, so an open V still reaches
  the vertex. Round-trips through `@weasel-js/svg` as `marker-*` attributes plus
  `<marker>` defs.
