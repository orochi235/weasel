# weasel performance TODO

Open work whose subject is a cost: the kit's time, frames, allocations and memory at runtime, and how
fast the test suite and dev servers run. Everything else open is in `docs/TODO.md`, whose priority and
owner tags these entries use. How to time a frame, and the specs that measure these: `tests/perf/README.md`.

When work merges, retire its entry here in the same change.

## Renderer and the batch

- **(P3) [waiting] Whether the batched path costs a co-tenant on the same page.** Reported, not measured
  here. A consumer benchmarking its wall against a canvas2d control found that at one rung the
  *canvas2d* side went from ~8.8 ms to 102-160 ms, and only when the page also held a build with
  the merged batch. Reproducible in both directions.

  Its seven rungs narrow it to an interaction. Five rungs share one byte-identical 12MB atlas, and
  only the densest of them is anomalous — canvas2d costs 160.4 ms at 16px / 2,700 commands against
  5.2 at 24px / 1,419, on the same sheet — so it is not residency. The two rungs with *more*
  commands, 8px at 7,500 and 12px at 4,275, are fine on a smaller sheet, so it is not command
  count. What is unique is the pair: the most commands anyone draws against the large texture.

  Two axes move together across that ladder and want separating. Holding the cell at 16px and
  drawing fewer of them varies command count at a fixed 2:1 minification; drawing 24px cells until
  the count reaches 2,700 varies the sampling ratio at a fixed count. A cell drawn from a sheet
  never samples mipmaps, so a minified draw scatters its taps, and 16px is where a 32px tile is
  minified hardest by anything drawing that many of them.

  **The control has to run in their harness.** Every number in it is canvas2d on a page that also
  holds a WebGL2 context. Nobody has measured that rung with no GL context at all, so "the batch
  costs its co-tenant" and "this rung is expensive whenever GL is resident, and the batch only
  changes the timing" are not yet separated. Nothing in this repo can take that run: no spec under
  `tests/perf/` draws with canvas2d, and `atlas-wall.spec.ts`, which builds walls of this shape,
  draws them only through `WeaselRenderer` (checked 2026-10-17). It is one run on their side, the
  16px / 2,700-command rung with the GL build left off the page, and it could retire the entry.
  Closes when the consumer reports that run, or on 2026-12-01 with none, delete it.

## Benchmarks in CI

- **(P3) [maintainer] The pull request benchmark job has never run on GitHub.** All 46 `perf-pr.yml` runs from 2026-10-11
  to 2026-10-29 were on changesets' release pull request (`changeset-release/main`, opened by
  `github-actions[bot]`), the only pull requests this repo gets. Each waited for a maintainer's approval
  and none got it: 36 sit at "action required", and 10 failed with no jobs once the approval expired
  ("This workflow run required approval but was not approved before it expired"). So its run time with
  `HVD_APPROACHES=hud` (estimated at 80 minutes against a 120-minute limit, since 2026-10-26) is still
  unmeasured, as is whether the base, measured first, reads differently from the head for that alone.
  Approve one run of the release pull request, or open a pull request from a branch, to get a first
  reading. Checked 2026-10-29.
  Closes when one `perf-pr.yml` run finishes its jobs on GitHub and its run time is recorded, or on
  2026-12-01 with none, delete it.

## forge and dev servers

- **(P3) [maintainer] forge serves ui and labkit file by file unless `WEASEL_DEV_BUNDLE_STORIES=1`.** Their
  stories import through package specifiers, so the flag bundles both (`scripts/vite-prebundle.ts`).
  Measured 2026-10-21: a forge load falls from 1,624 requests to 1,270, and at 20 ms of emulated
  latency from 7.1 s to 4.5 s to network idle; a ui component edit goes from a 0.28 s hot update to
  a ~3.6 s re-bundle and reload. Whether to make it the default is the open decision. Under the flag,
  159 of the 1,270 requests are Badge's `shapes/`, `bases/` and `effects/`, which the Badge story and
  its `lab/` import by path because ui does not export them; removing those needs a published
  subpath.
  Closes when the maintainer has ruled on making the flag forge's default and the ruling is in place.
